I&mdash;OUR SOCIETY</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the first place, Cranford is in
possession of the Amazons; all the holders of houses above a
certain rent are women.&nbsp; If a married couple come to settle
in the town, somehow the gentleman disappears; he is either
fairly frightened to death by being the only man in the Cranford
evening parties, or he is accounted for by being with his
regiment, his ship, or closely engaged in business all the week
in the great neighbouring commercial town of Drumble, distant
only twenty miles on a railroad.&nbsp; In short, whatever does
become of the gentlemen, they are not at Cranford.&nbsp; What
could they do if they were there?&nbsp; The surgeon has his round
of thirty miles, and sleeps at Cranford; but every man cannot be
a surgeon.&nbsp; For keeping the trim gardens full of choice
flowers without a weed to speck them; for frightening away little
boys who look wistfully at the said flowers through the railings;
for rushing out at the geese <a name="page2"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 2</span>that occasionally venture in to the
gardens if the gates are left open; for deciding all questions of
literature and politics without troubling themselves with
unnecessary reasons or arguments; for obtaining clear and correct
knowledge of everybody&rsquo;s affairs in the parish; for keeping
their neat maid-servants in admirable order; for kindness
(somewhat dictatorial) to the poor, and real tender good offices
to each other whenever they are in distress, the ladies of
Cranford are quite sufficient.&nbsp; &ldquo;A man,&rdquo; as one
of them observed to me once, &ldquo;is <i>so</i> in the way in
the house!&rdquo;&nbsp; Although the ladies of Cranford know all
each other&rsquo;s proceedings, they are exceedingly indifferent
to each other&rsquo;s opinions.&nbsp; Indeed, as each has her own
individuality, not to say eccentricity, pretty strongly
developed, nothing is so easy as verbal retaliation; but,
somehow, good-will reigns among them to a considerable
degree.</p>
<p>The Cranford ladies have only an occasional little quarrel,
spirited out in a few peppery words and angry jerks of the head;
just enough to prevent the even tenor of their lives from
becoming too flat.&nbsp; Their dress is very independent of
fashion; as they observe, &ldquo;What does it signify how we
dress here at Cranford, where everybody knows us?&rdquo;&nbsp;
And if they go from home, their reason is equally cogent,
&ldquo;What does it signify how we dress here, where nobody knows
us?&rdquo;&nbsp; The materials of their clothes are, in general,
good and plain, and most of them are nearly as scrupulous as Miss
Tyler, of cleanly memory; but I will answer for it, the last
gigot, the last tight and scanty petticoat in wear in England,
was seen in Cranford&mdash;and seen without a smile.</p>

</a></p>
<p><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>I can
testify to a magnificent family red silk umbrella, under which a
gentle little spinster, left alone of many brothers and sisters,
used to patter to church on rainy days.&nbsp; Have you any red
silk umbrellas in London?&nbsp; We had a tradition of the first
that had ever been seen in Cranford; and the little boys mobbed
it, and called it &ldquo;a stick in petticoats.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
might have been the very red silk one I have described, held by a
strong father over a troop of little ones; the poor little
lady&mdash;the survivor of all&mdash;could scarcely carry it.</p>
<p>Then there were rules and regulations for visiting and calls;
and they were announced to any young people who might be staying
in the town, with all the solemnity with which the old Manx laws
were read once a year on the Tinwald Mount.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our friends have sent to inquire how you are after your
journey to-night, my dear&rdquo; (fifteen miles in a
gentleman&rsquo;s carriage); &ldquo;they will give you some rest
to-morrow, but the next day, I have no doubt, they will call; so
be at liberty after twelve&mdash;from twelve to three are our
calling hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, after they had called&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the third day; I dare say your mamma has told
you, my dear, never to let more than three days elapse between
receiving a call and returning it; and also, that you are never
to stay longer than a quarter of an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But am I to look at my watch?&nbsp; How am I to find
out when a quarter of an hour has passed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must keep thinking about the time, my dear, and not
allow yourself to forget it in conversation.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>As
everybody had this rule in their minds, whether they received or
paid a call, of course no absorbing subject was ever spoken
about.&nbsp; We kept ourselves to short sentences of small talk,
and were punctual to our time.</p>
<p>I imagine that a few of the gentlefolks of Cranford were poor,
and had some difficulty in making both ends meet; but they were
like the Spartans, and concealed their smart under a smiling
face.&nbsp; We none of us spoke of money, because that subject
savoured of commerce and trade, and though some might be poor, we
were all aristocratic.&nbsp; The Cranfordians had that kindly
<i>esprit de corps</i> which made them overlook all deficiencies
in success when some among them tried to conceal their
poverty.&nbsp; When Mrs Forrester, for instance, gave a party in
her baby-house of a dwelling, and the little maiden disturbed the
ladies on the sofa by a request that she might get the tea-tray
out from underneath, everyone took this novel proceeding as the
most natural thing in the world, and talked on about household
forms and ceremonies as if we all believed that our hostess had a
regular servants&rsquo; hall, second table, with housekeeper and
steward, instead of the one little charity-school maiden, whose
short ruddy arms could never have been strong enough to carry the
tray upstairs, if she had not been assisted in private by her
mistress, who now sat in state, pretending not to know what cakes
were sent up, though she knew, and we knew, and she knew that we
knew, and we knew that she knew that we knew, she had been busy
all the morning making tea-bread and sponge-cakes.</p>
<p><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>There
were one or two consequences arising from this general but
unacknowledged poverty, and this very much acknowledged
gentility, which were not amiss, and which might be introduced
into many circles of society to their great improvement.&nbsp;
For instance, the inhabitants of Cranford kept early hours, and
clattered home in their pattens, under the guidance of a
lantern-bearer, about nine o&rsquo;clock at night; and the whole
town was abed and asleep by half-past ten.&nbsp; Moreover, it was
considered &ldquo;vulgar&rdquo; (a tremendous word in Cranford)
to give anything expensive, in the way of eatable or drinkable,
at the evening entertainments.&nbsp; Wafer bread-and-butter and
sponge-biscuits were all that the Honourable Mrs Jamieson gave;
and she was sister-in-law to the late Earl of Glenmire, although
she did practise such &ldquo;elegant economy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elegant economy!&rdquo;&nbsp; How naturally one falls
back into the phraseology of Cranford!&nbsp; There, economy was
always &ldquo;elegant,&rdquo; and money-spending always
&ldquo;vulgar and ostentatious&rdquo;; a sort of sour-grapeism
which made us very peaceful and satisfied.&nbsp; I never shall
forget the dismay felt when a certain Captain Brown came to live
at Cranford, and openly spoke about his being poor&mdash;not in a
whisper to an intimate friend, the doors and windows being
previously closed, but in the public street! in a loud military
voice! alleging his poverty as a reason for not taking a
particular house.&nbsp; The ladies of Cranford were already
rather moaning over the invasion of their territories by a man
and a gentleman.&nbsp; He was a half-pay captain, and had
obtained some situation on a neighbouring railroad, which had <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>been vehemently
petitioned against by the little town; and if, in addition to his
masculine gender, and his connection with the obnoxious railroad,
he was so brazen as to talk of being poor&mdash;why, then,
indeed, he must be sent to Coventry.&nbsp; Death was as true and
as common as poverty; yet people never spoke about that, loud out
in the streets.&nbsp; It was a word not to be mentioned to ears
polite.&nbsp; We had tacitly agreed to ignore that any with whom
we associated on terms of visiting equality could ever be
prevented by poverty from doing anything that they wished.&nbsp;
If we walked to or from a party, it was because the night was
<i>so</i> fine, or the air <i>so</i> refreshing, not because
sedan-chairs were expensive.&nbsp; If we wore prints, instead of
summer silks, it was because we preferred a washing material; and
so on, till we blinded ourselves to the vulgar fact that we were,
all of us, people of very moderate means.&nbsp; Of course, then,
we did not know what to make of a man who could speak of poverty
as if it was not a disgrace.&nbsp; Yet, somehow, Captain Brown
made himself respected in Cranford, and was called upon, in spite
of all resolutions to the contrary.&nbsp; I was surprised to hear
his opinions quoted as authority at a visit which I paid to
Cranford about a year after he had settled in the town.&nbsp; My
own friends had been among the bitterest opponents of any
proposal to visit the Captain and his daughters, only twelve
months before; and now he was even admitted in the tabooed hours
before twelve.&nbsp; True, it was to discover the cause of a
smoking chimney, before the fire was lighted; but still Captain
Brown walked upstairs, nothing daunted, spoke in a voice too
large for the room, and joked <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>quite in the way of a tame man about
the house.&nbsp; He had been blind to all the small slights, and
omissions of trivial ceremonies, with which he had been
received.&nbsp; He had been friendly, though the Cranford ladies
had been cool; he had answered small sarcastic compliments in
good faith; and with his manly frankness had overpowered all the
shrinking which met him as a man who was not ashamed to be
poor.&nbsp; And, at last, his excellent masculine common sense,
and his facility in devising expedients to overcome domestic
dilemmas, had gained him an extraordinary place as authority
among the Cranford ladies.&nbsp; He himself went on in his
course, as unaware of his popularity as he had been of the
reverse; and I am sure he was startled one day when he found his
advice so highly esteemed as to make some counsel which he had
given in jest to be taken in sober, serious earnest.</p>
<p>It was on this subject: An old lady had an Alderney cow, which
she looked upon as a daughter.&nbsp; You could not pay the short
quarter of an hour call without being told of the wonderful milk
or wonderful intelligence of this animal.&nbsp; The whole town
knew and kindly regarded Miss Betsy Barker&rsquo;s Alderney;
therefore great was the sympathy and regret when, in an unguarded
moment, the poor cow tumbled into a lime-pit.&nbsp; She moaned so
loudly that she was soon heard and rescued; but meanwhile the
poor beast had lost most of her hair, and came out looking naked,
cold, and miserable, in a bare skin.&nbsp; Everybody pitied the
animal, though a few could not restrain their smiles at her droll
appearance.&nbsp; Miss Betsy Barker absolutely cried with sorrow
and dismay; <a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>and it was said she thought of trying a bath of
oil.&nbsp; This remedy, perhaps, was recommended by some one of
the number whose advice she asked; but the proposal, if ever it
was made, was knocked on the head by Captain Brown&rsquo;s
decided &ldquo;Get her a flannel waistcoat and flannel drawers,
ma&rsquo;am, if you wish to keep her alive.&nbsp; But my advice
is, kill the poor creature at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Betsy Barker dried her eyes, and thanked the Captain
heartily; she set to work, and by-and-by all the town turned out
to see the Alderney meekly going to her pasture, clad in dark
grey flannel.&nbsp; I have watched her myself many a time.&nbsp;
Do you ever see cows dressed in grey flannel in London?</p>

<p>Captain Brown had taken a small house on the outskirts of the
town, where he lived with his two daughters.&nbsp; He must have
been upwards of sixty at the time of the first visit I paid to
Cranford after I had left it as a residence.&nbsp; But he had a
wiry, well-trained, elastic figure, a stiff military throw-back
of his head, and a springing step, which made him appear much
younger than he was.&nbsp; His eldest daughter looked almost as
old as himself, and betrayed the fact that his real was more than
his apparent age.&nbsp; Miss Brown must have been forty; she had
a sickly, pained, careworn expression on her face, and looked as
if the gaiety of youth had long faded out of sight.&nbsp; Even
when young she must have been plain and hard-featured.&nbsp; Miss
Jessie Brown was ten years younger than her sister, and twenty
shades prettier.&nbsp; Her face was round and dimpled.&nbsp; Miss
Jenkyns once said, in a passion against Captain Brown (the cause
of which I will tell you presently), <a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>&ldquo;that she thought it was time
for Miss Jessie to leave off her dimples, and not always to be
trying to look like a child.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was true there was
something childlike in her face; and there will be, I think, till
she dies, though she should live to a hundred.&nbsp; Her eyes
were large blue wondering eyes, looking straight at you; her nose
was unformed and snub, and her lips were red and dewy; she wore
her hair, too, in little rows of curls, which heightened this
appearance.&nbsp; I do not know whether she was pretty or not;
but I liked her face, and so did everybody, and I do not think
she could help her dimples.&nbsp; She had something of her
father&rsquo;s jauntiness of gait and manner; and any female
observer might detect a slight difference in the attire of the
two sisters&mdash;that of Miss Jessie being about two pounds per
annum more expensive than Miss Brown&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Two pounds
was a large sum in Captain Brown&rsquo;s annual
disbursements.</p>
<p>Such was the impression made upon me by the Brown family when
I first saw them all together in Cranford Church.&nbsp; The
Captain I had met before&mdash;on the occasion of the smoky
chimney, which he had cured by some simple alteration in the
flue.&nbsp; In church, he held his double eye-glass to his eyes
during the Morning Hymn, and then lifted up his head erect and
sang out loud and joyfully.&nbsp; He made the responses louder
than the clerk&mdash;an old man with a piping feeble voice, who,
I think, felt aggrieved at the Captain&rsquo;s sonorous bass, and
quivered higher and higher in consequence.</p>
<p>On coming out of church, the brisk Captain paid the most
gallant attention to his two daughters.&nbsp; <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>He nodded and
smiled to his acquaintances; but he shook hands with none until
he had helped Miss Brown to unfurl her umbrella, had relieved her
of her prayer-book, and had waited patiently till she, with
trembling nervous hands, had taken up her gown to walk through
the wet roads.</p>
<p>I wonder what the Cranford ladies did with Captain Brown at
their parties.&nbsp; We had often rejoiced, in former days, that
there was no gentleman to be attended to, and to find
conversation for, at the card-parties.&nbsp; We had congratulated
ourselves upon the snugness of the evenings; and, in our love for
gentility, and distaste of mankind, we had almost persuaded
ourselves that to be a man was to be &ldquo;vulgar&rdquo;; so
that when I found my friend and hostess, Miss Jenkyns, was going
to have a party in my honour, and that Captain and the Miss
Browns were invited, I wondered much what would be the course of
the evening.&nbsp; Card-tables, with green baize tops, were set
out by daylight, just as usual; it was the third week in
November, so the evenings closed in about four.&nbsp; Candles,
and clean packs of cards, were arranged on each table.&nbsp; The
fire was made up; the neat maid-servant had received her last
directions; and there we stood, dressed in our best, each with a
candle-lighter in our hands, ready to dart at the candles as soon
as the first knock came.&nbsp; Parties in Cranford were solemn
festivities, making the ladies feel gravely elated as they sat
together in their best dresses.&nbsp; As soon as three had
arrived, we sat down to &ldquo;Preference,&rdquo; I being the
unlucky fourth.&nbsp; The next four comers were put down
immediately to another table; and presently the tea-trays, <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>which I had
seen set out in the store-room as I passed in the morning, were
placed each on the middle of a card-table.&nbsp; The china was
delicate egg-shell; the old-fashioned silver glittered with
polishing; but the eatables were of the slightest
description.&nbsp; While the trays were yet on the tables,
Captain and the Miss Browns came in; and I could see that,
somehow or other, the Captain was a favourite with all the ladies
present.&nbsp; Ruffled brows were smoothed, sharp voices lowered
at his approach.&nbsp; Miss Brown looked ill, and depressed
almost to gloom.&nbsp; Miss Jessie smiled as usual, and seemed
nearly as popular as her father.&nbsp; He immediately and quietly
assumed the man&rsquo;s place in the room; attended to every
one&rsquo;s wants, lessened the pretty maid-servant&rsquo;s
labour by waiting on empty cups and bread-and-butterless ladies;
and yet did it all in so easy and dignified a manner, and so much
as if it were a matter of course for the strong to attend to the
weak, that he was a true man throughout.&nbsp; He played for
threepenny points with as grave an interest as if they had been
pounds; and yet, in all his attention to strangers, he had an eye
on his suffering daughter&mdash;for suffering I was sure she was,
though to many eyes she might only appear to be irritable.&nbsp;
Miss Jessie could not play cards: but she talked to the
sitters-out, who, before her coming, had been rather inclined to
be cross.&nbsp; She sang, too, to an old cracked piano, which I
think had been a spinet in its youth.&nbsp; Miss Jessie sang,
&ldquo;Jock of Hazeldean&rdquo; a little out of tune; but we were
none of us musical, though Miss Jenkyns beat time, out of time,
by way of appearing to be so.</p>
<p><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>It was
very good of Miss Jenkyns to do this; for I had seen that, a
little before, she had been a good deal annoyed by Miss Jessie
Brown&rsquo;s unguarded admission (<i>&agrave; propos</i> of
Shetland wool) that she had an uncle, her mother&rsquo;s brother,
who was a shop-keeper in Edinburgh.&nbsp; Miss Jenkyns tried to
drown this confession by a terrible cough&mdash;for the
Honourable Mrs Jamieson was sitting at a card-table nearest Miss
Jessie, and what would she say or think if she found out she was
in the same room with a shop-keeper&rsquo;s niece!&nbsp; But Miss
Jessie Brown (who had no tact, as we all agreed the next morning)
<i>would</i> repeat the information, and assure Miss Pole she
could easily get her the identical Shetland wool required,
&ldquo;through my uncle, who has the best assortment of Shetland
goods of any one in Edinbro&rsquo;.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was to take
the taste of this out of our mouths, and the sound of this out of
our ears, that Miss Jenkyns proposed music; so I say again, it
was very good of her to beat time to the song.</p>
<p>When the trays re-appeared with biscuits and wine, punctually
at a quarter to nine, there was conversation, comparing of cards,
and talking over tricks; but by-and-by Captain Brown sported a
bit of literature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you seen any numbers of &lsquo;The Pickwick
Papers&rsquo;?&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; (They were then publishing
in parts.)&nbsp; &ldquo;Capital thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now Miss Jenkyns was daughter of a deceased rector of
Cranford; and, on the strength of a number of manuscript sermons,
and a pretty good library of divinity, considered herself
literary, and looked upon any conversation about books as a <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>challenge to
her.&nbsp; So she answered and said, &ldquo;Yes, she had seen
them; indeed, she might say she had read them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what do you think of them?&rdquo; exclaimed Captain
Brown.&nbsp; &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t they famously good?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So urged Miss Jenkyns could not but speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must say, I don&rsquo;t think they are by any means
equal to Dr Johnson.&nbsp; Still, perhaps, the author is
young.&nbsp; Let him persevere, and who knows what he may become
if he will take the great Doctor for his model?&rdquo;&nbsp; This
was evidently too much for Captain Brown to take placidly; and I
saw the words on the tip of his tongue before Miss Jenkyns had
finished her sentence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is quite a different sort of thing, my dear
madam,&rdquo; he began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am quite aware of that,&rdquo; returned she.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And I make allowances, Captain Brown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just allow me to read you a scene out of this
month&rsquo;s number,&rdquo; pleaded he.&nbsp; &ldquo;I had it
only this morning, and I don&rsquo;t think the company can have
read it yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you please,&rdquo; said she, settling herself with
an air of resignation.&nbsp; He read the account of the
&ldquo;swarry&rdquo; which Sam Weller gave at Bath.&nbsp; Some of
us laughed heartily.&nbsp; <i>I</i> did not dare, because I was
staying in the house.&nbsp; Miss Jenkyns sat in patient
gravity.&nbsp; When it was ended, she turned to me, and said with
mild dignity&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fetch me &lsquo;Rasselas,&rsquo; my dear, out of the
book-room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When I had brought it to her, she turned to Captain
Brown&mdash;</p>
<p><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>&ldquo;Now allow <i>me</i> to read you a scene, and then
the present company can judge between your favourite, Mr Boz, and
Dr Johnson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She read one of the conversations between Rasselas and Imlac,
in a high-pitched, majestic voice: and when she had ended, she
said, &ldquo;I imagine I am now justified in my preference of Dr
Johnson as a writer of fiction.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Captain screwed
his lips up, and drummed on the table, but he did not
speak.&nbsp; She thought she would give him a finishing blow or
two.</p>

</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;I consider it vulgar, and below the dignity of
literature, to publish in numbers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How was the <i>Rambler</i> published,
ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo; asked Captain Brown in a low voice, which I
think Miss Jenkyns could not have heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr Johnson&rsquo;s style is a model for young
beginners.&nbsp; My father recommended it to me when I began to
write letters&mdash;I have formed my own style upon it; I
recommended it to your favourite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should be very sorry for him to exchange his style
for any such pompous writing,&rdquo; said Captain Brown.</p>
<p>Miss Jenkyns felt this as a personal affront, in a way of
which the Captain had not dreamed.&nbsp; Epistolary writing she
and her friends considered as her <i>forte</i>.&nbsp; Many a copy
of many a letter have I seen written and corrected on the slate,
before she &ldquo;seized the half-hour just previous to post-time
to assure&rdquo; her friends of this or of that; and Dr Johnson
was, as she said, her model in these compositions.&nbsp; She drew
herself up with dignity, <a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>and only replied to Captain
Brown&rsquo;s last remark by saying, with marked emphasis on
every syllable, &ldquo;I prefer Dr Johnson to Mr Boz.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is said&mdash;I won&rsquo;t vouch for the fact&mdash;that
Captain Brown was heard to say, <i>sotto voce</i>, &ldquo;D-n Dr
Johnson!&rdquo;&nbsp; If he did, he was penitent afterwards, as
he showed by going to stand near Miss Jenkyns&rsquo; arm-chair,
and endeavouring to beguile her into conversation on some more
pleasing subject.&nbsp; But she was inexorable.&nbsp; The next
day she made the remark I have mentioned about Miss
Jessie&rsquo;s dimples.</p>
<h2><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>CHAPTER II&mdash;THE CAPTAIN</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was impossible to live a month
at Cranford and not know the daily habits of each resident; and
long before my visit was ended I knew much concerning the whole
Brown trio.&nbsp; There was nothing new to be discovered
respecting their poverty; for they had spoken simply and openly
about that from the very first.&nbsp; They made no mystery of the
necessity for their being economical.&nbsp; All that remained to
be discovered was the Captain&rsquo;s infinite kindness of heart,
and the various modes in which, unconsciously to himself, he
manifested it.&nbsp; Some little anecdotes were talked about for
some time after they occurred.&nbsp; As we did not read much, and
as all the ladies were pretty well suited with servants, there
was a dearth of subjects for conversation.&nbsp; We therefore
discussed the circumstance of the Captain taking a poor old
woman&rsquo;s dinner out of her hands one very slippery
Sunday.&nbsp; He had met her returning from the bakehouse as he
came from church, and noticed her precarious footing; and, with
the grave dignity with which he did everything, he relieved her
of her burden, and steered along the <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>street by her side, carrying her
baked mutton and potatoes safely home.&nbsp; This was thought
very eccentric; and it was rather expected that he would pay a
round of calls, on the Monday morning, to explain and apologise
to the Cranford sense of propriety: but he did no such thing: and
then it was decided that he was ashamed, and was keeping out of
sight.&nbsp; In a kindly pity for him, we began to say,
&ldquo;After all, the Sunday morning&rsquo;s occurrence showed
great goodness of heart,&rdquo; and it was resolved that he
should be comforted on his next appearance amongst us; but, lo!
he came down upon us, untouched by any sense of shame, speaking
loud and bass as ever, his head thrown back, his wig as jaunty
and well-curled as usual, and we were obliged to conclude he had
forgotten all about Sunday.</p>
<p>Miss Pole and Miss Jessie Brown had set up a kind of intimacy
on the strength of the Shetland wool and the new knitting
stitches; so it happened that when I went to visit Miss Pole I
saw more of the Browns than I had done while staying with Miss
Jenkyns, who had never got over what she called Captain
Brown&rsquo;s disparaging remarks upon Dr Johnson as a writer of
light and agreeable fiction.&nbsp; I found that Miss Brown was
seriously ill of some lingering, incurable complaint, the pain
occasioned by which gave the uneasy expression to her face that I
had taken for unmitigated crossness.&nbsp; Cross, too, she was at
times, when the nervous irritability occasioned by her disease
became past endurance.&nbsp; Miss Jessie bore with her at these
times, even more patiently than she did with the bitter
self-upbraidings by which they <a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>were invariably succeeded.&nbsp; Miss
Brown used to accuse herself, not merely of hasty and irritable
temper, but also of being the cause why her father and sister
were obliged to pinch, in order to allow her the small luxuries
which were necessaries in her condition.&nbsp; She would so fain
have made sacrifices for them, and have lightened their cares,
that the original generosity of her disposition added acerbity to
her temper.&nbsp; All this was borne by Miss Jessie and her
father with more than placidity&mdash;with absolute
tenderness.&nbsp; I forgave Miss Jessie her singing out of tune,
and her juvenility of dress, when I saw her at home.&nbsp; I came
to perceive that Captain Brown&rsquo;s dark Brutus wig and padded
coat (alas! too often threadbare) were remnants of the military
smartness of his youth, which he now wore unconsciously.&nbsp; He
was a man of infinite resources, gained in his barrack
experience.&nbsp; As he confessed, no one could black his boots
to please him except himself; but, indeed, he was not above
saving the little maid-servant&rsquo;s labours in every
way&mdash;knowing, most likely, that his daughter&rsquo;s illness
made the place a hard one.</p>
<p>He endeavoured to make peace with Miss Jenkyns soon after the
memorable dispute I have named, by a present of a wooden
fire-shovel (his own making), having heard her say how much the
grating of an iron one annoyed her.&nbsp; She received the
present with cool gratitude, and thanked him formally.&nbsp; When
he was gone, she bade me put it away in the lumber-room; feeling,
probably, that no present from a man who preferred Mr Boz to Dr
Johnson could be less jarring than an iron fire-shovel.</p>
<p>Such was the state of things when I left Cranford <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>and went to
Drumble.&nbsp; I had, however, several correspondents, who kept
me <i>au fait</i> as to the proceedings of the dear little
town.&nbsp; There was Miss Pole, who was becoming as much
absorbed in crochet as she had been once in knitting, and the
burden of whose letter was something like, &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t
you forget the white worsted at Flint&rsquo;s&rdquo; of the old
song; for at the end of every sentence of news came a fresh
direction as to some crochet commission which I was to execute
for her.&nbsp; Miss Matilda Jenkyns (who did not mind being
called Miss Matty, when Miss Jenkyns was not by) wrote nice,
kind, rambling letters, now and then venturing into an opinion of
her own; but suddenly pulling herself up, and either begging me
not to name what she had said, as Deborah thought differently,
and <i>she</i> knew, or else putting in a postscript to the
effect that, since writing the above, she had been talking over
the subject with Deborah, and was quite convinced that,
etc.&mdash;(here probably followed a recantation of every opinion
she had given in the letter).&nbsp; Then came Miss
Jenkyns&mdash;Deborah, as she liked Miss Matty to call her, her
father having once said that the Hebrew name ought to be so
pronounced.&nbsp; I secretly think she took the Hebrew prophetess
for a model in character; and, indeed, she was not unlike the
stern prophetess in some ways, making allowance, of course, for
modern customs and difference in dress.&nbsp; Miss Jenkyns wore a
cravat, and a little bonnet like a jockey-cap, and altogether had
the appearance of a strong-minded woman; although she would have
despised the modern idea of women being equal to men.&nbsp;
Equal, indeed! she knew they were superior.&nbsp; But to return
to her letters.&nbsp; Everything <a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>in them was stately and grand like
herself.&nbsp; I have been looking them over (dear Miss Jenkyns,
how I honoured her!) and I will give an extract, more especially
because it relates to our friend Captain Brown:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Honourable Mrs Jamieson has only just quitted me;
and, in the course of conversation, she communicated to me the
intelligence that she had yesterday received a call from her
revered husband&rsquo;s quondam friend, Lord Mauleverer.&nbsp;
You will not easily conjecture what brought his lordship within
the precincts of our little town.&nbsp; It was to see Captain
Brown, with whom, it appears, his lordship was acquainted in the
&lsquo;plumed wars,&rsquo; and who had the privilege of averting
destruction from his lordship&rsquo;s head when some great peril
was impending over it, off the misnomered Cape of Good
Hope.&nbsp; You know our friend the Honourable Mrs
Jamieson&rsquo;s deficiency in the spirit of innocent curiosity,
and you will therefore not be so much surprised when I tell you
she was quite unable to disclose to me the exact nature of the
peril in question.&nbsp; I was anxious, I confess, to ascertain
in what manner Captain Brown, with his limited establishment,
could receive so distinguished a guest; and I discovered that his
lordship retired to rest, and, let us hope, to refreshing
slumbers, at the Angel Hotel; but shared the Brunonian meals
during the two days that he honoured Cranford with his august
presence.&nbsp; Mrs Johnson, our civil butcher&rsquo;s wife,
informs me that Miss Jessie purchased a leg of lamb; but, besides
this, I can hear of no preparation whatever to give a suitable
reception to so distinguished a visitor.&nbsp; <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>Perhaps they
entertained him with &lsquo;the feast of reason and the flow of
soul&rsquo;; and to us, who are acquainted with Captain
Brown&rsquo;s sad want of relish for &lsquo;the pure wells of
English undefiled,&rsquo; it may be matter for congratulation
that he has had the opportunity of improving his taste by holding
converse with an elegant and refined member of the British
aristocracy.&nbsp; But from some mundane failings who is
altogether free?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Pole and Miss Matty wrote to me by the same post.&nbsp;
Such a piece of news as Lord Mauleverer&rsquo;s visit was not to
be lost on the Cranford letter-writers: they made the most of
it.&nbsp; Miss Matty humbly apologised for writing at the same
time as her sister, who was so much more capable than she to
describe the honour done to Cranford; but in spite of a little
bad spelling, Miss Matty&rsquo;s account gave me the best idea of
the commotion occasioned by his lordship&rsquo;s visit, after it
had occurred; for, except the people at the Angel, the Browns,
Mrs Jamieson, and a little lad his lordship had sworn at for
driving a dirty hoop against the aristocratic legs, I could not
hear of any one with whom his lordship had held conversation.</p>
<p>My next visit to Cranford was in the summer.&nbsp; There had
been neither births, deaths, nor marriages since I was there
last.&nbsp; Everybody lived in the same house, and wore pretty
nearly the same well-preserved, old-fashioned clothes.&nbsp; The
greatest event was, that Miss Jenkyns had purchased a new carpet
for the drawing-room.&nbsp; Oh, the busy work Miss Matty and I
had in chasing the sunbeams, as they fell in an afternoon right
down on this carpet through <a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>the blindless window!&nbsp; We spread
newspapers over the places and sat down to our book or our work;
and, lo! in a quarter of an hour the sun had moved, and was
blazing away on a fresh spot; and down again we went on our knees
to alter the position of the newspapers.&nbsp; We were very busy,
too, one whole morning, before Miss Jenkyns gave her party, in
following her directions, and in cutting out and stitching
together pieces of newspaper so as to form little paths to every
chair set for the expected visitors, lest their shoes might dirty
or defile the purity of the carpet.&nbsp; Do you make paper paths
for every guest to walk upon in London?</p>
<p>Captain Brown and Miss Jenkyns were not very cordial to each
other.&nbsp; The literary dispute, of which I had seen the
beginning, was a &ldquo;raw,&rdquo; the slightest touch on which
made them wince.&nbsp; It was the only difference of opinion they
had ever had; but that difference was enough.&nbsp; Miss Jenkyns
could not refrain from talking at Captain Brown; and, though he
did not reply, he drummed with his fingers, which action she felt
and resented as very disparaging to Dr Johnson.&nbsp; He was
rather ostentatious in his preference of the writings of Mr Boz;
would walk through the streets so absorbed in them that he all
but ran against Miss Jenkyns; and though his apologies were
earnest and sincere, and though he did not, in fact, do more than
startle her and himself, she owned to me she had rather he had
knocked her down, if he had only been reading a higher style of
literature.&nbsp; The poor, brave Captain! he looked older, and
more worn, and his clothes were very threadbare.&nbsp; But he
seemed as bright and cheerful <a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>as ever, unless he was asked about
his daughter&rsquo;s health.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She suffers a great deal, and she must suffer more: we
do what we can to alleviate her pain;&mdash;God&rsquo;s will be
done!&rdquo;&nbsp; He took off his hat at these last words.&nbsp;
I found, from Miss Matty, that everything had been done, in
fact.&nbsp; A medical man, of high repute in that country
neighbourhood, had been sent for, and every injunction he had
given was attended to, regardless of expense.&nbsp; Miss Matty
was sure they denied themselves many things in order to make the
invalid comfortable; but they never spoke about it; and as for
Miss Jessie!&mdash;&ldquo;I really think she&rsquo;s an
angel,&rdquo; said poor Miss Matty, quite overcome.&nbsp;
&ldquo;To see her way of bearing with Miss Brown&rsquo;s
crossness, and the bright face she puts on after she&rsquo;s been
sitting up a whole night and scolded above half of it, is quite
beautiful.&nbsp; Yet she looks as neat and as ready to welcome
the Captain at breakfast-time as if she had been asleep in the
Queen&rsquo;s bed all night.&nbsp; My dear! you could never laugh
at her prim little curls or her pink bows again if you saw her as
I have done.&rdquo;&nbsp; I could only feel very penitent, and
greet Miss Jessie with double respect when I met her next.&nbsp;
She looked faded and pinched; and her lips began to quiver, as if
she was very weak, when she spoke of her sister.&nbsp; But she
brightened, and sent back the tears that were glittering in her
pretty eyes, as she said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, to be sure, what a town Cranford is for
kindness!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t suppose any one has a better dinner
than usual cooked but the best part of all comes in a little
covered basin for my sister.&nbsp; The <a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>poor people will leave their earliest
vegetables at our door for her.&nbsp; They speak short and gruff,
as if they were ashamed of it: but I am sure it often goes to my
heart to see their thoughtfulness.&rdquo;&nbsp; The tears now
came back and overflowed; but after a minute or two she began to
scold herself, and ended by going away the same cheerful Miss
Jessie as ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why does not this Lord Mauleverer do something for
the man who saved his life?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you see, unless Captain Brown has some reason for
it, he never speaks about being poor; and he walked along by his
lordship looking as happy and cheerful as a prince; and as they
never called attention to their dinner by apologies, and as Miss
Brown was better that day, and all seemed bright, I daresay his
lordship never knew how much care there was in the
background.&nbsp; He did send game in the winter pretty often,
but now he is gone abroad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had often occasion to notice the use that was made of
fragments and small opportunities in Cranford; the rose-leaves
that were gathered ere they fell to make into a potpourri for
someone who had no garden; the little bundles of lavender flowers
sent to strew the drawers of some town-dweller, or to burn in the
chamber of some invalid.&nbsp; Things that many would despise,
and actions which it seemed scarcely worth while to perform, were
all attended to in Cranford.&nbsp; Miss Jenkyns stuck an apple
full of cloves, to be heated and smell pleasantly in Miss
Brown&rsquo;s room; and as she put in each clove she uttered a
Johnsonian sentence.&nbsp; Indeed, she never could think of the
Browns without talking Johnson; <a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>and, as they were seldom absent from
her thoughts just then, I heard many a rolling, three-piled
sentence.</p>
<p>Captain Brown called one day to thank Miss Jenkyns for many
little kindnesses, which I did not know until then that she had
rendered.&nbsp; He had suddenly become like an old man; his deep
bass voice had a quavering in it, his eyes looked dim, and the
lines on his face were deep.&nbsp; He did not&mdash;could
not&mdash;speak cheerfully of his daughter&rsquo;s state, but he
talked with manly, pious resignation, and not much.&nbsp; Twice
over he said, &ldquo;What Jessie has been to us, God only
knows!&rdquo; and after the second time, he got up hastily, shook
hands all round without speaking, and left the room.</p>
<p>That afternoon we perceived little groups in the street, all
listening with faces aghast to some tale or other.&nbsp; Miss
Jenkyns wondered what could be the matter for some time before
she took the undignified step of sending Jenny out to
inquire.</p>
<p>Jenny came back with a white face of terror.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh,
ma&rsquo;am!&nbsp; Oh, Miss Jenkyns, ma&rsquo;am!&nbsp; Captain
Brown is killed by them nasty cruel railroads!&rdquo; and she
burst into tears.&nbsp; She, along with many others, had
experienced the poor Captain&rsquo;s kindness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&mdash;where&mdash;where?&nbsp; Good God!&nbsp;
Jenny, don&rsquo;t waste time in crying, but tell us
something.&rdquo;&nbsp; Miss Matty rushed out into the street at
once, and collared the man who was telling the tale.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p24b.jpg">
<img alt=
"She brought the affrighted carter . . . into the drawing-room"

"She brought the affrighted carter . . . into the drawing-room"
src="images/p24s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in&mdash;come to my sister at once, Miss Jenkyns,
the rector&rsquo;s daughter.&nbsp; Oh, man, man! say it is not
true,&rdquo; she cried, as she brought the affrighted carter,
sleeking down his hair, into the drawing-room, <a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>where he
stood with his wet boots on the new carpet, and no one regarded
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, mum, it is true.&nbsp; I seed it myself,&rdquo;
and he shuddered at the recollection.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Captain
was a-reading some new book as he was deep in, a-waiting for the
down train; and there was a little lass as wanted to come to its
mammy, and gave its sister the slip, and came toddling across the
line.&nbsp; And he looked up sudden, at the sound of the train
coming, and seed the child, and he darted on the line and cotched
it up, and his foot slipped, and the train came over him in no
time.&nbsp; O Lord, Lord!&nbsp; Mum, it&rsquo;s quite true, and
they&rsquo;ve come over to tell his daughters.&nbsp; The
child&rsquo;s safe, though, with only a bang on its shoulder as
he threw it to its mammy.&nbsp; Poor Captain would be glad of
that, mum, wouldn&rsquo;t he?&nbsp; God bless him!&rdquo;&nbsp;
The great rough carter puckered up his manly face, and turned
away to hide his tears.&nbsp; I turned to Miss Jenkyns.&nbsp; She
looked very ill, as if she were going to faint, and signed to me
to open the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Matilda, bring me my bonnet.&nbsp; I must go to those
girls.&nbsp; God pardon me, if ever I have spoken contemptuously
to the Captain!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Jenkyns arrayed herself to go out, telling Miss Matilda
to give the man a glass of wine.&nbsp; While she was away, Miss
Matty and I huddled over the fire, talking in a low and
awe-struck voice.&nbsp; I know we cried quietly all the time.</p>
<p>Miss Jenkyns came home in a silent mood, and we durst not ask
her many questions.&nbsp; She told us that Miss Jessie had
fainted, and that she and Miss Pole had had some difficulty in
bringing her round; <a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>but that, as soon as she recovered, she begged one of
them to go and sit with her sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr Hoggins says she cannot live many days, and she
shall be spared this shock,&rdquo; said Miss Jessie, shivering
with feelings to which she dared not give way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how can you manage, my dear?&rdquo; asked Miss
Jenkyns; &ldquo;you cannot bear up, she must see your
tears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God will help me&mdash;I will not give way&mdash;she
was asleep when the news came; she may be asleep yet.&nbsp; She
would be so utterly miserable, not merely at my father&rsquo;s
death, but to think of what would become of me; she is so good to
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; She looked up earnestly in their faces with her
soft true eyes, and Miss Pole told Miss Jenkyns afterwards she
could hardly bear it, knowing, as she did, how Miss Brown treated
her sister.</p>
<p>However, it was settled according to Miss Jessie&rsquo;s
wish.&nbsp; Miss Brown was to be told her father had been
summoned to take a short journey on railway business.&nbsp; They
had managed it in some way&mdash;Miss Jenkyns could not exactly
say how.&nbsp; Miss Pole was to stop with Miss Jessie.&nbsp; Mrs
Jamieson had sent to inquire.&nbsp; And this was all we heard
that night; and a sorrowful night it was.&nbsp; The next day a
full account of the fatal accident was in the county paper which
Miss Jenkyns took in.&nbsp; Her eyes were very weak, she said,
and she asked me to read it.&nbsp; When I came to the
&ldquo;gallant gentleman was deeply engaged in the perusal of a
number of &lsquo;Pickwick,&rsquo; which he had just
received,&rdquo; Miss Jenkyns shook her head long and solemnly,
and then sighed out, &ldquo;Poor, dear, infatuated
man!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>The
corpse was to be taken from the station to the parish church,
there to be interred.&nbsp; Miss Jessie had set her heart on
following it to the grave; and no dissuasives could alter her
resolve.&nbsp; Her restraint upon herself made her almost
obstinate; she resisted all Miss Pole&rsquo;s entreaties and Miss
Jenkyns&rsquo; advice.&nbsp; At last Miss Jenkyns gave up the
point; and after a silence, which I feared portended some deep
displeasure against Miss Jessie, Miss Jenkyns said she should
accompany the latter to the funeral.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not fit for you to go alone.&nbsp; It would be
against both propriety and humanity were I to allow
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Jessie seemed as if she did not half like this
arrangement; but her obstinacy, if she had any, had been
exhausted in her determination to go to the interment.&nbsp; She
longed, poor thing, I have no doubt, to cry alone over the grave
of the dear father to whom she had been all in all, and to give
way, for one little half-hour, uninterrupted by sympathy and
unobserved by friendship.&nbsp; But it was not to be.&nbsp; That
afternoon Miss Jenkyns sent out for a yard of black crape, and
employed herself busily in trimming the little black silk bonnet
I have spoken about.&nbsp; When it was finished she put it on,
and looked at us for approbation&mdash;admiration she
despised.&nbsp; I was full of sorrow, but, by one of those
whimsical thoughts which come unbidden into our heads, in times
of deepest grief, I no sooner saw the bonnet than I was reminded
of a helmet; and in that hybrid bonnet, half helmet, half
jockey-cap, did Miss Jenkyns attend Captain Brown&rsquo;s
funeral, and, I believe, supported Miss Jessie with a tender, <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>indulgent
firmness which was invaluable, allowing her to weep her
passionate fill before they left.</p>
<p>Miss Pole, Miss Matty, and I, meanwhile attended to Miss
Brown: and hard work we found it to relieve her querulous and
never-ending complaints.&nbsp; But if we were so weary and
dispirited, what must Miss Jessie have been!&nbsp; Yet she came
back almost calm as if she had gained a new strength.&nbsp; She
put off her mourning dress, and came in, looking pale and gentle,
thanking us each with a soft long pressure of the hand.&nbsp; She
could even smile&mdash;a faint, sweet, wintry smile&mdash;as if
to reassure us of her power to endure; but her look made our eyes
fill suddenly with tears, more than if she had cried
outright.</p>
<p>It was settled that Miss Pole was to remain with her all the
watching livelong night; and that Miss Matty and I were to return
in the morning to relieve them, and give Miss Jessie the
opportunity for a few hours of sleep.&nbsp; But when the morning
came, Miss Jenkyns appeared at the breakfast-table, equipped in
her helmet-bonnet, and ordered Miss Matty to stay at home, as she
meant to go and help to nurse.&nbsp; She was evidently in a state
of great friendly excitement, which she showed by eating her
breakfast standing, and scolding the household all round.</p>
<p>No nursing&mdash;no energetic strong-minded woman could help
Miss Brown now.&nbsp; There was that in the room as we entered
which was stronger than us all, and made us shrink into solemn
awestruck helplessness.&nbsp; Miss Brown was dying.&nbsp; We
hardly knew her voice, it was so devoid of the complaining tone
we had always associated with it.&nbsp; Miss Jessie <a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>told me
afterwards that it, and her face too, were just what they had
been formerly, when her mother&rsquo;s death left her the young
anxious head of the family, of whom only Miss Jessie
survived.</p>
<p>She was conscious of her sister&rsquo;s presence, though not,
I think, of ours.&nbsp; We stood a little behind the curtain:
Miss Jessie knelt with her face near her sister&rsquo;s, in order
to catch the last soft awful whispers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jessie!&nbsp; Jessie!&nbsp; How selfish I have
been!&nbsp; God forgive me for letting you sacrifice yourself for
me as you did!&nbsp; I have so loved you&mdash;and yet I have
thought only of myself.&nbsp; God forgive me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, love! hush!&rdquo; said Miss Jessie, sobbing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And my father, my dear, dear father!&nbsp; I will not
complain now, if God will give me strength to be patient.&nbsp;
But, oh, Jessie! tell my father how I longed and yearned to see
him at last, and to ask his forgiveness.&nbsp; He can never know
now how I loved him&mdash;oh! if I might but tell him, before I
die!&nbsp; What a life of sorrow his has been, and I have done so
little to cheer him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A light came into Miss Jessie&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; &ldquo;Would
it comfort you, dearest, to think that he does know?&mdash;would
it comfort you, love, to know that his cares, his
sorrows&rdquo;&mdash;Her voice quivered, but she steadied it into
calmness&mdash;&ldquo;Mary! he has gone before you to the place
where the weary are at rest.&nbsp; He knows now how you loved
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A strange look, which was not distress, came over Miss
Brown&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; She did not speak for come time, but
then we saw her lips form the words, <a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>rather than heard the
sound&mdash;&ldquo;Father, mother, Harry,
Archy;&rdquo;&mdash;then, as if it were a new idea throwing a
filmy shadow over her darkened mind&mdash;&ldquo;But you will be
alone, Jessie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Jessie had been feeling this all during the silence, I
think; for the tears rolled down her cheeks like rain, at these
words, and she could not answer at first.&nbsp; Then she put her
hands together tight, and lifted them up, and said&mdash;but not
to us&mdash;&ldquo;Though He slay me, yet will I trust in
Him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a few moments more Miss Brown lay calm and
still&mdash;never to sorrow or murmur more.</p>
<p>After this second funeral, Miss Jenkyns insisted that Miss
Jessie should come to stay with her rather than go back to the
desolate house, which, in fact, we learned from Miss Jessie, must
now be given up, as she had not wherewithal to maintain it.&nbsp;
She had something above twenty pounds a year, besides the
interest of the money for which the furniture would sell; but she
could not live upon that: and so we talked over her
qualifications for earning money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can sew neatly,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and I like
nursing.&nbsp; I think, too, I could manage a house, if any one
would try me as housekeeper; or I would go into a shop as
saleswoman, if they would have patience with me at
first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Jenkyns declared, in an angry voice, that she should do
no such thing; and talked to herself about &ldquo;some people
having no idea of their rank as a captain&rsquo;s
daughter,&rdquo; nearly an hour afterwards, when she brought Miss
Jessie up a basin of delicately-made arrowroot, and stood over
her like a dragoon until the last spoonful was finished: then she
disappeared.&nbsp; <a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>Miss Jessie began to tell me some more of the plans
which had suggested themselves to her, and insensibly fell into
talking of the days that were past and gone, and interested me so
much I neither knew nor heeded how time passed.&nbsp; We were
both startled when Miss Jenkyns reappeared, and caught us
crying.&nbsp; I was afraid lest she would be displeased, as she
often said that crying hindered digestion, and I knew she wanted
Miss Jessie to get strong; but, instead, she looked queer and
excited, and fidgeted round us without saying anything.&nbsp; At
last she spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been so much startled&mdash;no, I&rsquo;ve not
been at all startled&mdash;don&rsquo;t mind me, my dear Miss
Jessie&mdash;I&rsquo;ve been very much surprised&mdash;in fact,
I&rsquo;ve had a caller, whom you knew once, my dear Miss
Jessie&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>Miss Jessie went very white, then flushed scarlet, and looked
eagerly at Miss Jenkyns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A gentleman, my dear, who wants to know if you would
see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it?&mdash;it is not&rdquo;&mdash;stammered out Miss
Jessie&mdash;and got no farther.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is his card,&rdquo; said Miss Jenkyns, giving it
to Miss Jessie; and while her head was bent over it, Miss Jenkyns
went through a series of winks and odd faces to me, and formed
her lips into a long sentence, of which, of course, I could not
understand a word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May he come up?&rdquo; asked Miss Jenkyns at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes! certainly!&rdquo; said Miss Jessie, as much as
to say, this is your house, you may show any visitor where you
like.&nbsp; She took up some knitting of Miss Matty&rsquo;s and
began to be very busy, though I could see how she trembled all
over.</p>
<p><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>Miss
Jenkyns rang the bell, and told the servant who answered it to
show Major Gordon upstairs; and, presently, in walked a tall,
fine, frank-looking man of forty or upwards.&nbsp; He shook hands
with Miss Jessie; but he could not see her eyes, she kept them so
fixed on the ground.&nbsp; Miss Jenkyns asked me if I would come
and help her to tie up the preserves in the store-room; and
though Miss Jessie plucked at my gown, and even looked up at me
with begging eye, I durst not refuse to go where Miss Jenkyns
asked.&nbsp; Instead of tying up preserves in the store-room,
however, we went to talk in the dining-room; and there Miss
Jenkyns told me what Major Gordon had told her; how he had served
in the same regiment with Captain Brown, and had become
acquainted with Miss Jessie, then a sweet-looking, blooming girl
of eighteen; how the acquaintance had grown into love on his
part, though it had been some years before he had spoken; how, on
becoming possessed, through the will of an uncle, of a good
estate in Scotland, he had offered and been refused, though with
so much agitation and evident distress that he was sure she was
not indifferent to him; and how he had discovered that the
obstacle was the fell disease which was, even then, too surely
threatening her sister.&nbsp; She had mentioned that the surgeons
foretold intense suffering; and there was no one but herself to
nurse her poor Mary, or cheer and comfort her father during the
time of illness.&nbsp; They had had long discussions; and on her
refusal to pledge herself to him as his wife when all should be
over, he had grown angry, and broken off entirely, and gone
abroad, believing that she was a cold-hearted person whom he
would do well to forget.&nbsp; <a name="page34"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>He had been travelling in the East,
and was on his return home when, at Rome, he saw the account of
Captain Brown&rsquo;s death in <i>Galignani</i>.</p>
<p>Just then Miss Matty, who had been out all the morning, and
had only lately returned to the house, burst in with a face of
dismay and outraged propriety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, goodness me!&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Deborah,
there&rsquo;s a gentleman sitting in the drawing-room with his
arm round Miss Jessie&rsquo;s waist!&rdquo;&nbsp; Miss
Matty&rsquo;s eyes looked large with terror.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p33b.jpg">
<img alt=
"&ldquo;With his arm around Miss Jessie&rsquo;s waist!&rdquo;"
title=
"&ldquo;With his arm around Miss Jessie&rsquo;s waist!&rdquo;"
src="images/p33s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Miss Jenkyns snubbed her down in an instant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The most proper place in the world for his arm to be
in.&nbsp; Go away, Matilda, and mind your own
business.&rdquo;&nbsp; This from her sister, who had hitherto
been a model of feminine decorum, was a blow for poor Miss Matty,
and with a double shock she left the room.</p>
<p>The last time I ever saw poor Miss Jenkyns was many years
after this.&nbsp; Mrs Gordon had kept up a warm and affectionate
intercourse with all at Cranford.&nbsp; Miss Jenkyns, Miss Matty,
and Miss Pole had all been to visit her, and returned with
wonderful accounts of her house, her husband, her dress, and her
looks.&nbsp; For, with happiness, something of her early bloom
returned; she had been a year or two younger than we had taken
her for.&nbsp; Her eyes were always lovely, and, as Mrs Gordon,
her dimples were not out of place.&nbsp; At the time to which I
have referred, when I last saw Miss Jenkyns, that lady was old
and feeble, and had lost something of her strong mind.&nbsp;
Little Flora Gordon was staying with the Misses Jenkyns, and when
I came in she was reading aloud to Miss <a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>Jenkyns, who
lay feeble and changed on the sofa.&nbsp; Flora put down the
<i>Rambler</i> when I came in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Miss Jenkyns, &ldquo;you find me
changed, my dear.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t see as I used to do.&nbsp;
If Flora were not here to read to me, I hardly know how I should
get through the day.&nbsp; Did you ever read the
<i>Rambler</i>?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a wonderful
book&mdash;wonderful! and the most improving reading for
Flora&rdquo; (which I daresay it would have been, if she could
have read half the words without spelling, and could have
understood the meaning of a third), &ldquo;better than that
strange old book, with the queer name, poor Captain Brown was
killed for reading&mdash;that book by Mr Boz, you
know&mdash;&lsquo;Old Poz&rsquo;; when I was a girl&mdash;but
that&rsquo;s a long time ago&mdash;I acted Lucy in &lsquo;Old
Poz.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; She babbled on long enough for Flora to
get a good long spell at the &ldquo;Christmas Carol,&rdquo; which
Miss Matty had left on the table.</p>

36</span>CHAPTER III&mdash;A LOVE AFFAIR OF LONG AGO</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">thought</span> that probably my
connection with Cranford would cease after Miss Jenkyns&rsquo;s
death; at least, that it would have to be kept up by
correspondence, which bears much the same relation to personal
intercourse that the books of dried plants I sometimes see
(&ldquo;Hortus Siccus,&rdquo; I think they call the thing) do to
the living and fresh flowers in the lines and meadows.&nbsp; I
was pleasantly surprised, therefore, by receiving a letter from
Miss Pole (who had always come in for a supplementary week after
my annual visit to Miss Jenkyns) proposing that I should go and
stay with her; and then, in a couple of days after my acceptance,
came a note from Miss Matty, in which, in a rather circuitous and
very humble manner, she told me how much pleasure I should confer
if I could spend a week or two with her, either before or after I
had been at Miss Pole&rsquo;s; &ldquo;for,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;since my dear sister&rsquo;s death I am well aware I have
no attractions to offer; it is only to the kindness of my friends
that I can owe their company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course I promised to come to dear Miss <a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>Matty as soon
as I had ended my visit to Miss Pole; and the day after my
arrival at Cranford I went to see her, much wondering what the
house would be like without Miss Jenkyns, and rather dreading the
changed aspect of things.&nbsp; Miss Matty began to cry as soon
as she saw me.&nbsp; She was evidently nervous from having
anticipated my call.&nbsp; I comforted her as well as I could;
and I found the best consolation I could give was the honest
praise that came from my heart as I spoke of the deceased.&nbsp;
Miss Matty slowly shook her head over each virtue as it was named
and attributed to her sister; and at last she could not restrain
the tears which had long been silently flowing, but hid her face
behind her handkerchief and sobbed aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Miss Matty,&rdquo; said I, taking her
hand&mdash;for indeed I did not know in what way to tell her how
sorry I was for her, left deserted in the world.&nbsp; She put
down her handkerchief and said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear, I&rsquo;d rather you did not call me
Matty.&nbsp; She did not like it; but I did many a thing she did
not like, I&rsquo;m afraid&mdash;and now she&rsquo;s gone!&nbsp;
If you please, my love, will you call me Matilda?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I promised faithfully, and began to practise the new name with
Miss Pole that very day; and, by degrees, Miss Matilda&rsquo;s
feeling on the subject was known through Cranford, and we all
tried to drop the more familiar name, but with so little success
that by-and-by we gave up the attempt.</p>
<p>My visit to Miss Pole was very quiet.&nbsp; Miss Jenkyns had
so long taken the lead in Cranford that now she was gone, they
hardly knew how to give a party.&nbsp; The Honourable Mrs
Jamieson, to whom <a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>Miss Jenkyns herself had always yielded the post of
honour, was fat and inert, and very much at the mercy of her old
servants.&nbsp; If they chose that she should give a party, they
reminded her of the necessity for so doing: if not, she let it
alone.&nbsp; There was all the more time for me to hear old-world
stories from Miss Pole, while she sat knitting, and I making my
father&rsquo;s shirts.&nbsp; I always took a quantity of plain
sewing to Cranford; for, as we did not read much, or walk much, I
found it a capital time to get through my work.&nbsp; One of Miss
Pole&rsquo;s stories related to a shadow of a love affair that
was dimly perceived or suspected long years before.</p>
<p>Presently, the time arrived when I was to remove to Miss
Matilda&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; I found her timid and anxious about
the arrangements for my comfort.&nbsp; Many a time, while I was
unpacking, did she come backwards and forwards to stir the fire
which burned all the worse for being so frequently poked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you drawers enough, dear?&rdquo; asked she.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know exactly how my sister used to arrange
them.&nbsp; She had capital methods.&nbsp; I am sure she would
have trained a servant in a week to make a better fire than this,
and Fanny has been with me four months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This subject of servants was a standing grievance, and I could
not wonder much at it; for if gentlemen were scarce, and almost
unheard of in the &ldquo;genteel society&rdquo; of Cranford, they
or their counterparts&mdash;handsome young men&mdash;abounded in
the lower classes.&nbsp; The pretty neat servant-maids had their
choice of desirable &ldquo;followers&rdquo;; and their
mistresses, without having the sort of mysterious <a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>dread of men
and matrimony that Miss Matilda had, might well feel a little
anxious lest the heads of their comely maids should be turned by
the joiner, or the butcher, or the gardener, who were obliged, by
their callings, to come to the house, and who, as ill-luck would
have it, were generally handsome and unmarried.&nbsp;
Fanny&rsquo;s lovers, if she had any&mdash;and Miss Matilda
suspected her of so many flirtations that, if she had not been
very pretty, I should have doubted her having one&mdash;were a
constant anxiety to her mistress.&nbsp; She was forbidden, by the
articles of her engagement, to have &ldquo;followers&rdquo;; and
though she had answered, innocently enough, doubling up the hem
of her apron as she spoke, &ldquo;Please, ma&rsquo;am, I never
had more than one at a time,&rdquo; Miss Matty prohibited that
one.&nbsp; But a vision of a man seemed to haunt the
kitchen.&nbsp; Fanny assured me that it was all fancy, or else I
should have said myself that I had seen a man&rsquo;s coat-tails
whisk into the scullery once, when I went on an errand into the
store-room at night; and another evening, when, our watches
having stopped, I went to look at the clock, there was a very odd
appearance, singularly like a young man squeezed up between the
clock and the back of the open kitchen-door: and I thought Fanny
snatched up the candle very hastily, so as to throw the shadow on
the clock face, while she very positively told me the time
half-an-hour too early, as we found out afterwards by the church
clock.&nbsp; But I did not add to Miss Matty&rsquo;s anxieties by
naming my suspicions, especially as Fanny said to me, the next
day, that it was such a queer kitchen for having odd shadows
about it, she really was almost afraid to stay; &ldquo;for <a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>you know,
miss,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see a creature from
six o&rsquo;clock tea, till Missus rings the bell for prayers at
ten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, it so fell out that Fanny had to leave and Miss
Matilda begged me to stay and &ldquo;settle her&rdquo; with the
new maid; to which I consented, after I had heard from my father
that he did not want me at home.&nbsp; The new servant was a
rough, honest-looking, country girl, who had only lived in a farm
place before; but I liked her looks when she came to be hired;
and I promised Miss Matilda to put her in the ways of the
house.&nbsp; The said ways were religiously such as Miss Matilda
thought her sister would approve.&nbsp; Many a domestic rule and
regulation had been a subject of plaintive whispered murmur to me
during Miss Jenkyns&rsquo;s life; but now that she was gone, I do
not think that even I, who was a favourite, durst have suggested
an alteration.&nbsp; To give an instance: we constantly adhered
to the forms which were observed, at meal-times, in &ldquo;my
father, the rector&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;&nbsp; Accordingly, we
had always wine and dessert; but the decanters were only filled
when there was a party, and what remained was seldom touched,
though we had two wine-glasses apiece every day after dinner,
until the next festive occasion arrived, when the state of the
remainder wine was examined into in a family council.&nbsp; The
dregs were often given to the poor: but occasionally, when a good
deal had been left at the last party (five months ago, it might
be), it was added to some of a fresh bottle, brought up from the
cellar.&nbsp; I fancy poor Captain Brown did not much like wine,
for I noticed he never finished his first glass, and <a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>most military
men take several.&nbsp; Then, as to our dessert, Miss Jenkyns
used to gather currants and gooseberries for it herself, which I
sometimes thought would have tasted better fresh from the trees;
but then, as Miss Jenkyns observed, there would have been nothing
for dessert in summer-time.&nbsp; As it was, we felt very genteel
with our two glasses apiece, and a dish of gooseberries at the
top, of currants and biscuits at the sides, and two decanters at
the bottom.&nbsp; When oranges came in, a curious proceeding was
gone through.&nbsp; Miss Jenkyns did not like to cut the fruit;
for, as she observed, the juice all ran out nobody knew where;
sucking (only I think she used some more recondite word) was in
fact the only way of enjoying oranges; but then there was the
unpleasant association with a ceremony frequently gone through by
little babies; and so, after dessert, in orange season, Miss
Jenkyns and Miss Matty used to rise up, possess themselves each
of an orange in silence, and withdraw to the privacy of their own
rooms to indulge in sucking oranges.</p>
<p>I had once or twice tried, on such occasions, to prevail on
Miss Matty to stay, and had succeeded in her sister&rsquo;s
lifetime.&nbsp; I held up a screen, and did not look, and, as she
said, she tried not to make the noise very offensive; but now
that she was left alone, she seemed quite horrified when I begged
her to remain with me in the warm dining-parlour, and enjoy her
orange as she liked best.&nbsp; And so it was in
everything.&nbsp; Miss Jenkyns&rsquo;s rules were made more
stringent than ever, because the framer of them was gone where
there could be no appeal.&nbsp; In all things else Miss Matilda
was meek and undecided to a fault.&nbsp; <a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>I have heard
Fanny turn her round twenty times in a morning about dinner, just
as the little hussy chose; and I sometimes fancied she worked on
Miss Matilda&rsquo;s weakness in order to bewilder her, and to
make her feel more in the power of her clever servant.&nbsp; I
determined that I would not leave her till I had seen what sort
of a person Martha was; and, if I found her trustworthy, I would
tell her not to trouble her mistress with every little
decision.</p>
<p>Martha was blunt and plain-spoken to a fault; otherwise she
was a brisk, well-meaning, but very ignorant girl.&nbsp; She had
not been with us a week before Miss Matilda and I were astounded
one morning by the receipt of a letter from a cousin of hers, who
had been twenty or thirty years in India, and who had lately, as
we had seen by the &ldquo;Army List,&rdquo; returned to England,
bringing with him an invalid wife who had never been introduced
to her English relations.&nbsp; Major Jenkyns wrote to propose
that he and his wife should spend a night at Cranford, on his way
to Scotland&mdash;at the inn, if it did not suit Miss Matilda to
receive them into her house; in which case they should hope to be
with her as much as possible during the day.&nbsp; Of course it
<i>must</i> suit her, as she said; for all Cranford knew that she
had her sister&rsquo;s bedroom at liberty; but I am sure she
wished the Major had stopped in India and forgotten his cousins
out and out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! how must I manage?&rdquo; asked she
helplessly.&nbsp; &ldquo;If Deborah had been alive she would have
known what to do with a gentleman-visitor.&nbsp; Must I put
razors in his dressing-room?&nbsp; Dear! dear! and I&rsquo;ve got
none.&nbsp; Deborah would have had <a name="page43"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 43</span>them.&nbsp; And slippers, and
coat-brushes?&rdquo;&nbsp; I suggested that probably he would
bring all these things with him.&nbsp; &ldquo;And after dinner,
how am I to know when to get up and leave him to his wine?&nbsp;
Deborah would have done it so well; she would have been quite in
her element.&nbsp; Will he want coffee, do you
think?&rdquo;&nbsp; I undertook the management of the coffee, and
told her I would instruct Martha in the art of waiting&mdash;in
which it must be owned she was terribly deficient&mdash;and that
I had no doubt Major and Mrs Jenkyns would understand the quiet
mode in which a lady lived by herself in a country town.&nbsp;
But she was sadly fluttered.&nbsp; I made her empty her decanters
and bring up two fresh bottles of wine.&nbsp; I wished I could
have prevented her from being present at my instructions to
Martha, for she frequently cut in with some fresh direction,
muddling the poor girl&rsquo;s mind as she stood open-mouthed,
listening to us both.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hand the vegetables round,&rdquo; said I (foolishly, I
see now&mdash;for it was aiming at more than we could accomplish
with quietness and simplicity); and then, seeing her look
bewildered, I added, &ldquo;take the vegetables round to people,
and let them help themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And mind you go first to the ladies,&rdquo; put in Miss
Matilda.&nbsp; &ldquo;Always go to the ladies before gentlemen
when you are waiting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it as you tell me, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo;
said Martha; &ldquo;but I like lads best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We felt very uncomfortable and shocked at this speech of
Martha&rsquo;s, yet I don&rsquo;t think she meant any harm; and,
on the whole, she attended very well to our directions, except
that she &ldquo;nudged&rdquo; <a name="page44"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 44</span>the Major when he did not help
himself as soon as she expected to the potatoes, while she was
handing them round.</p>
<p>The major and his wife were quiet unpretending people enough
when they did come; languid, as all East Indians are, I
suppose.&nbsp; We were rather dismayed at their bringing two
servants with them, a Hindoo body-servant for the Major, and a
steady elderly maid for his wife; but they slept at the inn, and
took off a good deal of the responsibility by attending carefully
to their master&rsquo;s and mistress&rsquo;s comfort.&nbsp;
Martha, to be sure, had never ended her staring at the East
Indian&rsquo;s white turban and brown complexion, and I saw that
Miss Matilda shrunk away from him a little as he waited at
dinner.&nbsp; Indeed, she asked me, when they were gone, if he
did not remind me of Blue Beard?&nbsp; On the whole, the visit
was most satisfactory, and is a subject of conversation even now
with Miss Matilda; at the time it greatly excited Cranford, and
even stirred up the apathetic and Honourable Mrs Jamieson to some
expression of interest, when I went to call and thank her for the
kind answers she had vouchsafed to Miss Matilda&rsquo;s inquiries
as to the arrangement of a gentleman&rsquo;s
dressing-room&mdash;answers which I must confess she had given in
the wearied manner of the Scandinavian prophetess&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Leave me, leave
me to repose.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And <i>now</i> I come to the love affair.</p>
<p>It seems that Miss Pole had a cousin, once or twice removed,
who had offered to Miss Matty long ago.&nbsp; Now this cousin
lived four or five miles from <a name="page45"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 45</span>Cranford on his own estate; but his
property was not large enough to entitle him to rank higher than
a yeoman; or rather, with something of the &ldquo;pride which
apes humility,&rdquo; he had refused to push himself on, as so
many of his class had done, into the ranks of the squires.&nbsp;
He would not allow himself to be called Thomas Holbrook,
<i>Esq.</i>; he even sent back letters with this address, telling
the post-mistress at Cranford that his name was <i>Mr</i> Thomas
Holbrook, yeoman.&nbsp; He rejected all domestic innovations; he
would have the house door stand open in summer and shut in
winter, without knocker or bell to summon a servant.&nbsp; The
closed fist or the knob of a stick did this office for him if he
found the door locked.&nbsp; He despised every refinement which
had not its root deep down in humanity.&nbsp; If people were not
ill, he saw no necessity for moderating his voice.&nbsp; He spoke
the dialect of the country in perfection, and constantly used it
in conversation; although Miss Pole (who gave me these
particulars) added, that he read aloud more beautifully and with
more feeling than any one she had ever heard, except the late
rector.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how came Miss Matilda not to marry him?&rdquo;
asked I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; She was willing enough, I
think; but you know Cousin Thomas would not have been enough of a
gentleman for the rector and Miss Jenkyns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well! but they were not to marry him,&rdquo; said I,
impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; but they did not like Miss Matty to marry below her
rank.&nbsp; You know she was the <a name="page46"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 46</span>rector&rsquo;s daughter, and somehow
they are related to Sir Peter Arley: Miss Jenkyns thought a deal
of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Miss Matty!&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, now, I don&rsquo;t know anything more than that he
offered and was refused.&nbsp; Miss Matty might not like
him&mdash;and Miss Jenkyns might never have said a word&mdash;it
is only a guess of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has she never seen him since?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I think not.&nbsp; You see Woodley, Cousin
Thomas&rsquo;s house, lies half-way between Cranford and
Misselton; and I know he made Misselton his market-town very soon
after he had offered to Miss Matty; and I don&rsquo;t think he
has been into Cranford above once or twice since&mdash;once, when
I was walking with Miss Matty, in High Street, and suddenly she
darted from me, and went up Shire Lane.&nbsp; A few minutes after
I was startled by meeting Cousin Thomas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How old is he?&rdquo; I asked, after a pause of
castle-building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must be about seventy, I think, my dear,&rdquo; said
Miss Pole, blowing up my castle, as if by gun-powder, into small
fragments.</p>
<p>Very soon after&mdash;at least during my long visit to Miss
Matilda&mdash;I had the opportunity of seeing Mr Holbrook;
seeing, too, his first encounter with his former love, after
thirty or forty years&rsquo; separation.&nbsp; I was helping to
decide whether any of the new assortment of coloured silks which
they had just received at the shop would do to match a grey and
black mousseline-delaine that wanted a new breadth, when a tall,
thin, Don Quixote-looking old man <a name="page47"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 47</span>came into the shop for some woollen
gloves.&nbsp; I had never seen the person (who was rather
striking) before, and I watched him rather attentively while Miss
Matty listened to the shopman.&nbsp; The stranger wore a blue
coat with brass buttons, drab breeches, and gaiters, and drummed
with his fingers on the counter until he was attended to.&nbsp;
When he answered the shop-boy&rsquo;s question, &ldquo;What can I
have the pleasure of showing you to-day, sir?&rdquo; I saw Miss
Matilda start, and then suddenly sit down; and instantly I
guessed who it was.&nbsp; She had made some inquiry which had to
be carried round to the other shopman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Jenkyns wants the black sarsenet two-and-twopence
the yard&rdquo;; and Mr Holbrook had caught the name, and was
across the shop in two strides.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Matty&mdash;Miss Matilda&mdash;Miss Jenkyns!&nbsp; God
bless my soul!&nbsp; I should not have known you.&nbsp; How are
you? how are you?&rdquo;&nbsp; He kept shaking her hand in a way
which proved the warmth of his friendship; but he repeated so
often, as if to himself, &ldquo;I should not have known
you!&rdquo; that any sentimental romance which I might be
inclined to build was quite done away with by his manner.</p>
<p>However, he kept talking to us all the time we were in the
shop; and then waving the shopman with the unpurchased gloves on
one side, with &ldquo;Another time, sir! another time!&rdquo; he
walked home with us.&nbsp; I am happy to say my client, Miss
Matilda, also left the shop in an equally bewildered state, not
having purchased either green or red silk.&nbsp; Mr Holbrook was
evidently full with honest loud-spoken <a name="page48"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 48</span>joy at meeting his old love again; he
touched on the changes that had taken place; he even spoke of
Miss Jenkyns as &ldquo;Your poor sister!&nbsp; Well, well! we
have all our faults&rdquo;; and bade us good-bye with many a hope
that he should soon see Miss Matty again.&nbsp; She went straight
to her room, and never came back till our early tea-time, when I
thought she looked as if she had been crying.</p>

49</span>CHAPTER IV&mdash;A VISIT TO AN OLD BACHELOR</h2>
<p>A <span class="smcap">few</span> days after, a note came from
Mr Holbrook, asking us&mdash;impartially asking both of
us&mdash;in a formal, old-fashioned style, to spend a day at his
house&mdash;a long June day&mdash;for it was June now.&nbsp; He
named that he had also invited his cousin, Miss Pole; so that we
might join in a fly, which could be put up at his house.</p>
<p>I expected Miss Matty to jump at this invitation; but,
no!&nbsp; Miss Pole and I had the greatest difficulty in
persuading her to go.&nbsp; She thought it was improper; and was
even half annoyed when we utterly ignored the idea of any
impropriety in her going with two other ladies to see her old
lover.&nbsp; Then came a more serious difficulty.&nbsp; She did
not think Deborah would have liked her to go.&nbsp; This took us
half a day&rsquo;s good hard talking to get over; but, at the
first sentence of relenting, I seized the opportunity, and wrote
and despatched an acceptance in her name&mdash;fixing day and
hour, that all might be decided and done with.</p>
<p>The next morning she asked me if I would go down to the shop
with her; and there, after much <a name="page50"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 50</span>hesitation, we chose out three caps
to be sent home and tried on, that the most becoming might be
selected to take with us on Thursday.</p>
<p>She was in a state of silent agitation all the way to
Woodley.&nbsp; She had evidently never been there before; and,
although she little dreamt I knew anything of her early story, I
could perceive she was in a tremor at the thought of seeing the
place which might have been her home, and round which it is
probable that many of her innocent girlish imaginations had
clustered.&nbsp; It was a long drive there, through paved jolting
lanes.&nbsp; Miss Matilda sat bolt upright, and looked wistfully
out of the windows as we drew near the end of our journey.&nbsp;
The aspect of the country was quiet and pastoral.&nbsp; Woodley
stood among fields; and there was an old-fashioned garden where
roses and currant-bushes touched each other, and where the
feathery asparagus formed a pretty background to the pinks and
gilly-flowers; there was no drive up to the door.&nbsp; We got
out at a little gate, and walked up a straight box-edged
path.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My cousin might make a drive, I think,&rdquo; said Miss
Pole, who was afraid of ear-ache, and had only her cap on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it is very pretty,&rdquo; said Miss Matty, with
a soft plaintiveness in her voice, and almost in a whisper, for
just then Mr Holbrook appeared at the door, rubbing his hands in
very effervescence of hospitality.&nbsp; He looked more like my
idea of Don Quixote than ever, and yet the likeness was only
external.&nbsp; His respectable housekeeper stood modestly at the
door to bid us welcome; and, while she led <a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>the elder
ladies upstairs to a bedroom, I begged to look about the
garden.&nbsp; My request evidently pleased the old gentleman, who
took me all round the place and showed me his six-and-twenty
cows, named after the different letters of the alphabet.&nbsp; As
we went along, he surprised me occasionally by repeating apt and
beautiful quotations from the poets, ranging easily from
Shakespeare and George Herbert to those of our own day.&nbsp; He
did this as naturally as if he were thinking aloud, and their
true and beautiful words were the best expression he could find
for what he was thinking or feeling.&nbsp; To be sure he called
Byron &ldquo;my Lord Byrron,&rdquo; and pronounced the name of
Goethe strictly in accordance with the English sound of the
letters&mdash;&ldquo;As Goethe says, &lsquo;Ye ever-verdant
palaces,&rsquo;&rdquo; &amp;c.&nbsp; Altogether, I never met with
a man, before or since, who had spent so long a life in a
secluded and not impressive country, with ever-increasing delight
in the daily and yearly change of season and beauty.</p>
<p>When he and I went in, we found that dinner was nearly ready
in the kitchen&mdash;for so I suppose the room ought to be
called, as there were oak dressers and cupboards all round, all
over by the side of the fireplace, and only a small Turkey carpet
in the middle of the flag-floor.&nbsp; The room might have been
easily made into a handsome dark oak dining-parlour by removing
the oven and a few other appurtenances of a kitchen, which were
evidently never used, the real cooking-place being at some
distance.&nbsp; The room in which we were expected to sit was a
stiffly-furnished, ugly apartment; but that in which we did sit
was what Mr Holbrook <a name="page52"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 52</span>called the counting-house, where he
paid his labourers their weekly wages at a great desk near the
door.&nbsp; The rest of the pretty sitting-room&mdash;looking
into the orchard, and all covered over with dancing
tree-shadows&mdash;was filled with books.&nbsp; They lay on the
ground, they covered the walls, they strewed the table.&nbsp; He
was evidently half ashamed and half proud of his extravagance in
this respect.&nbsp; They were of all kinds&mdash;poetry and wild
weird tales prevailing.&nbsp; He evidently chose his books in
accordance with his own tastes, not because such and such were
classical or established favourites.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we farmers ought not to have
much time for reading; yet somehow one can&rsquo;t help
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a pretty room!&rdquo; said Miss Matty, <i>sotto
voce</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a pleasant place!&rdquo; said I, aloud, almost
simultaneously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay! if you like it,&rdquo; replied he; &ldquo;but can
you sit on these great, black leather, three-cornered
chairs?&nbsp; I like it better than the best parlour; but I
thought ladies would take that for the smarter place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the smarter place, but, like most smart things, not at
all pretty, or pleasant, or home-like; so, while we were at
dinner, the servant-girl dusted and scrubbed the counting-house
chairs, and we sat there all the rest of the day.</p>
<p>We had pudding before meat; and I thought Mr Holbrook was
going to make some apology for his old-fashioned ways, for he
began&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether you like newfangled
ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
53</span>&ldquo;Oh, not at all!&rdquo; said Miss Matty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more do I,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;My
house-keeper <i>will</i> have these in her new fashion; or else I
tell her that, when I was a young man, we used to keep strictly
to my father&rsquo;s rule, &lsquo;No broth, no ball; no ball, no
beef&rsquo;; and always began dinner with broth.&nbsp; Then we
had suet puddings, boiled in the broth with the beef: and then
the meat itself.&nbsp; If we did not sup our broth, we had no
ball, which we liked a deal better; and the beef came last of
all, and only those had it who had done justice to the broth and
the ball.&nbsp; Now folks begin with sweet things, and turn their
dinners topsy-turvy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the ducks and green peas came, we looked at each other in
dismay; we had only two-pronged, black-handled forks.&nbsp; It is
true the steel was as bright as silver; but what were we to
do?&nbsp; Miss Matty picked up her peas, one by one, on the point
of the prongs, much as Amin&eacute; ate her grains of rice after
her previous feast with the Ghoul.&nbsp; Miss Pole sighed over
her delicate young peas as she left them on one side of her plate
untasted, for they <i>would</i> drop between the prongs.&nbsp; I
looked at my host: the peas were going wholesale into his
capacious mouth, shovelled up by his large round-ended
knife.&nbsp; I saw, I imitated, I survived!&nbsp; My friends, in
spite of my precedent, could not muster up courage enough to do
an ungenteel thing; and, if Mr Holbrook had not been so heartily
hungry, he would probably have seen that the good peas went away
almost untouched.</p>
<p>After dinner, a clay pipe was brought in, and <a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>a spittoon;
and, asking us to retire to another room, where he would soon
join us, if we disliked tobacco-smoke, he presented his pipe to
Miss Matty, and requested her to fill the bowl.&nbsp; This was a
compliment to a lady in his youth; but it was rather
inappropriate to propose it as an honour to Miss Matty, who had
been trained by her sister to hold smoking of every kind in utter
abhorrence.&nbsp; But if it was a shock to her refinement, it was
also a gratification to her feelings to be thus selected; so she
daintily stuffed the strong tobacco into the pipe, and then we
withdrew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is very pleasant dining with a bachelor,&rdquo; said
Miss Matty softly, as we settled ourselves in the
counting-house.&nbsp; &ldquo;I only hope it is not improper; so
many pleasant things are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a number of books he has!&rdquo; said Miss Pole,
looking round the room.&nbsp; &ldquo;And how dusty they
are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it must be like one of the great Dr
Johnson&rsquo;s rooms,&rdquo; said Miss Matty.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
a superior man your cousin must be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; said Miss Pole, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s a great
reader; but I am afraid he has got into very uncouth habits with
living alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! uncouth is too hard a word.&nbsp; I should call him
eccentric; very clever people always are!&rdquo; replied Miss
Matty.</p>

</a></p>
<p>When Mr Holbrook returned, he proposed a walk in the fields;
but the two elder ladies were afraid of damp, and dirt, and had
only very unbecoming calashes to put on over their caps; so they
declined, and I was again his companion in a turn <a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>which he said
he was obliged to take to see after his men.&nbsp; He strode
along, either wholly forgetting my existence, or soothed into
silence by his pipe&mdash;and yet it was not silence
exactly.&nbsp; He walked before me with a stooping gait, his
hands clasped behind him; and, as some tree or cloud, or glimpse
of distant upland pastures, struck him, he quoted poetry to
himself, saying it out loud in a grand sonorous voice, with just
the emphasis that true feeling and appreciation give.&nbsp; We
came upon an old cedar tree, which stood at one end of the
house&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The cedar spreads his dark-green layers of
shade.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Capital term&mdash;&lsquo;layers!&rsquo;&nbsp;
Wonderful man!&rdquo;&nbsp; I did not know whether he was
speaking to me or not; but I put in an assenting
&ldquo;wonderful,&rdquo; although I knew nothing about it, just
because I was tired of being forgotten, and of being consequently
silent.</p>
<p>He turned sharp round.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ay! you may say
&lsquo;wonderful.&rsquo;&nbsp; Why, when I saw the review of his
poems in <i>Blackwood</i>, I set off within an hour, and walked
seven miles to Misselton (for the horses were not in the way) and
ordered them.&nbsp; Now, what colour are ash-buds in
March?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Is the man going mad? thought I.&nbsp; He is very like Don
Quixote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What colour are they, I say?&rdquo; repeated he
vehemently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure I don&rsquo;t know, sir,&rdquo; said I, with
the meekness of ignorance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew you didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; No more did I&mdash;an
old fool that I am!&mdash;till this young man comes and tells
me.&nbsp; Black as ash-buds in March.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;ve lived
<a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>all my
life in the country; more shame for me not to know.&nbsp; Black:
they are jet-black, madam.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he went off again,
swinging along to the music of some rhyme he had got hold of.</p>
<p>When we came back, nothing would serve him but he must read us
the poems he had been speaking of; and Miss Pole encouraged him
in his proposal, I thought, because she wished me to hear his
beautiful reading, of which she had boasted; but she afterwards
said it was because she had got to a difficult part of her
crochet, and wanted to count her stitches without having to
talk.&nbsp; Whatever he had proposed would have been right to
Miss Matty; although she did fall sound asleep within five
minutes after he had begun a long poem, called &ldquo;Locksley
Hall,&rdquo; and had a comfortable nap, unobserved, till he
ended; when the cessation of his voice wakened her up, and she
said, feeling that something was expected, and that Miss Pole was
counting&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a pretty book!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty, madam! it&rsquo;s beautiful!&nbsp; Pretty,
indeed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes!&nbsp; I meant beautiful!&rdquo; said she,
fluttered at his disapproval of her word.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is so
like that beautiful poem of Dr Johnson&rsquo;s my sister used to
read&mdash;I forget the name of it; what was it, my dear?&rdquo;
turning to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which do you mean, ma&rsquo;am?&nbsp; What was it
about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember what it was about, and
I&rsquo;ve quite forgotten what the name of it was; but it was
written by Dr Johnson, and was very beautiful, and very like what
Mr Holbrook has just been reading.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember it,&rdquo; said he
reflectively.&nbsp; <a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
57</span>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t know Dr Johnson&rsquo;s poems
well.&nbsp; I must read them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As we were getting into the fly to return, I heard Mr Holbrook
say he should call on the ladies soon, and inquire how they got
home; and this evidently pleased and fluttered Miss Matty at the
time he said it; but after we had lost sight of the old house
among the trees her sentiments towards the master of it were
gradually absorbed into a distressing wonder as to whether Martha
had broken her word, and seized on the opportunity of her
mistress&rsquo;s absence to have a &ldquo;follower.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Martha looked good, and steady, and composed enough, as she came
to help us out; she was always careful of Miss Matty, and
to-night she made use of this unlucky speech&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh! dear ma&rsquo;am, to think of your going out in an
evening in such a thin shawl!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s no better than
muslin.&nbsp; At your age, ma&rsquo;am, you should be
careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My age!&rdquo; said Miss Matty, almost speaking
crossly, for her, for she was usually gentle&mdash;&ldquo;My
age!&nbsp; Why, how old do you think I am, that you talk about my
age?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, ma&rsquo;am, I should say you were not far short
of sixty: but folks&rsquo; looks is often against them&mdash;and
I&rsquo;m sure I meant no harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Martha, I&rsquo;m not yet fifty-two!&rdquo; said Miss
Matty, with grave emphasis; for probably the remembrance of her
youth had come very vividly before her this day, and she was
annoyed at finding that golden time so far away in the past.</p>
<p>But she never spoke of any former and more <a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>intimate
acquaintance with Mr Holbrook.&nbsp; She had probably met with so
little sympathy in her early love, that she had shut it up close
in her heart; and it was only by a sort of watching, which I
could hardly avoid since Miss Pole&rsquo;s confidence, that I saw
how faithful her poor heart had been in its sorrow and its
silence.</p>
<p>She gave me some good reason for wearing her best cap every
day, and sat near the window, in spite of her rheumatism, in
order to see, without being seen, down into the street.</p>
<p>He came.&nbsp; He put his open palms upon his knees, which
were far apart, as he sat with his head bent down, whistling,
after we had replied to his inquiries about our safe
return.&nbsp; Suddenly he jumped up&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, madam! have you any commands for Paris?&nbsp; I
am going there in a week or two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Paris!&rdquo; we both exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, madam!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve never been there, and
always had a wish to go; and I think if I don&rsquo;t go soon, I
mayn&rsquo;t go at all; so as soon as the hay is got in I shall
go, before harvest time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We were so much astonished that we had no commissions.</p>
<p>Just as he was going out of the room, he turned back, with his
favourite exclamation&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless my soul, madam! but I nearly forgot half my
errand.&nbsp; Here are the poems for you you admired so much the
other evening at my house.&rdquo;&nbsp; He tugged away at a
parcel in his coat-pocket.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good-bye, miss,&rdquo;
said he; &ldquo;good-bye, Matty! take care of
yourself.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he was gone.&nbsp; <a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>But he had
given her a book, and he had called her Matty, just as he used to
do thirty years to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish he would not go to Paris,&rdquo; said Miss
Matilda anxiously.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe frogs will
agree with him; he used to have to be very careful what he ate,
which was curious in so strong-looking a young man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon after this I took my leave, giving many an injunction to
Martha to look after her mistress, and to let me know if she
thought that Miss Matilda was not so well; in which case I would
volunteer a visit to my old friend, without noticing
Martha&rsquo;s intelligence to her.</p>
<p>Accordingly I received a line or two from Martha every now and
then; and, about November I had a note to say her mistress was
&ldquo;very low and sadly off her food&rdquo;; and the account
made me so uneasy that, although Martha did not decidedly summon
me, I packed up my things and went.</p>
<p>I received a warm welcome, in spite of the little flurry
produced by my impromptu visit, for I had only been able to give
a day&rsquo;s notice.&nbsp; Miss Matilda looked miserably ill;
and I prepared to comfort and cosset her.</p>
<p>I went down to have a private talk with Martha.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long has your mistress been so poorly?&rdquo; I
asked, as I stood by the kitchen fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&nbsp; I think it&rsquo;s better than a fortnight;
it is, I know; it was one Tuesday, after Miss Pole had been, that
she went into this moping way.&nbsp; I thought she was tired, and
it would go off with a night&rsquo;s rest; but no! she has gone
on and on ever since, till I thought it my duty to write to you,
ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
60</span>&ldquo;You did quite right, Martha.&nbsp; It is a
comfort to think she has so faithful a servant about her.&nbsp;
And I hope you find your place comfortable?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, ma&rsquo;am, missus is very kind, and
there&rsquo;s plenty to eat and drink, and no more work but what
I can do easily&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo; Martha hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what, Martha?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it seems so hard of missus not to let me have any
followers; there&rsquo;s such lots of young fellows in the town;
and many a one has as much as offered to keep company with me;
and I may never be in such a likely place again, and it&rsquo;s
like wasting an opportunity.&nbsp; Many a girl as I know would
have &rsquo;em unbeknownst to missus; but I&rsquo;ve given my
word, and I&rsquo;ll stick to it; or else this is just the house
for missus never to be the wiser if they did come: and it&rsquo;s
such a capable kitchen&mdash;there&rsquo;s such dark corners in
it&mdash;I&rsquo;d be bound to hide any one.&nbsp; I counted up
last Sunday night&mdash;for I&rsquo;ll not deny I was crying
because I had to shut the door in Jem Hearn&rsquo;s face, and
he&rsquo;s a steady young man, fit for any girl; only I had given
missus my word.&rdquo;&nbsp; Martha was all but crying again; and
I had little comfort to give her, for I knew, from old
experience, of the horror with which both the Miss Jenkynses
looked upon &ldquo;followers&rdquo;; and in Miss Matty&rsquo;s
present nervous state this dread was not likely to be
lessened.</p>
<p>I went to see Miss Pole the next day, and took her completely
by surprise, for she had not been to see Miss Matilda for two
days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now I must go back with you, my dear, for I
promised to let her know how Thomas Holbrook went on; and,
I&rsquo;m sorry to say, his housekeeper has <a
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>sent me word
to-day that he hasn&rsquo;t long to live.&nbsp; Poor Thomas! that
journey to Paris was quite too much for him.&nbsp; His
housekeeper says he has hardly ever been round his fields since,
but just sits with his hands on his knees in the counting-house,
not reading or anything, but only saying what a wonderful city
Paris was!&nbsp; Paris has much to answer for if it&rsquo;s
killed my cousin Thomas, for a better man never lived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does Miss Matilda know of his illness?&rdquo; asked
I&mdash;a new light as to the cause of her indisposition dawning
upon me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear! to be sure, yes!&nbsp; Has not she told
you?&nbsp; I let her know a fortnight ago, or more, when first I
heard of it.&nbsp; How odd she shouldn&rsquo;t have told
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not at all, I thought; but I did not say anything.&nbsp; I
felt almost guilty of having spied too curiously into that tender
heart, and I was not going to speak of its secrets&mdash;hidden,
Miss Matty believed, from all the world.&nbsp; I ushered Miss
Pole into Miss Matilda&rsquo;s little drawing-room, and then left
them alone.&nbsp; But I was not surprised when Martha came to my
bedroom door, to ask me to go down to dinner alone, for that
missus had one of her bad headaches.&nbsp; She came into the
drawing-room at tea-time, but it was evidently an effort to her;
and, as if to make up for some reproachful feeling against her
late sister, Miss Jenkyns, which had been troubling her all the
afternoon, and for which she now felt penitent, she kept telling
me how good and how clever Deborah was in her youth; how she used
to settle what gowns they were to wear at all the parties (faint,
<a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>ghostly
ideas of grim parties, far away in the distance, when Miss Matty
and Miss Pole were young!); and how Deborah and her mother had
started the benefit society for the poor, and taught girls
cooking and plain sewing; and how Deborah had once danced with a
lord; and how she used to visit at Sir Peter Arley&rsquo;s, and
tried to remodel the quiet rectory establishment on the plans of
Arley Hall, where they kept thirty servants; and how she had
nursed Miss Matty through a long, long illness, of which I had
never heard before, but which I now dated in my own mind as
following the dismissal of the suit of Mr Holbrook.&nbsp; So we
talked softly and quietly of old times through the long November
evening.</p>
<p>The next day Miss Pole brought us word that Mr Holbrook was
dead.&nbsp; Miss Matty heard the news in silence; in fact, from
the account of the previous day, it was only what we had to
expect.&nbsp; Miss Pole kept calling upon us for some expression
of regret, by asking if it was not sad that he was gone, and
saying&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To think of that pleasant day last June, when he seemed
so well!&nbsp; And he might have lived this dozen years if he had
not gone to that wicked Paris, where they are always having
revolutions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused for some demonstration on our part.&nbsp; I saw
Miss Matty could not speak, she was trembling so nervously; so I
said what I really felt; and after a call of some
duration&mdash;all the time of which I have no doubt Miss Pole
thought Miss Matty received the news very calmly&mdash;our
visitor took her leave.</p>
<p>Miss Matty made a strong effort to conceal her <a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
63</span>feelings&mdash;a concealment she practised even with me,
for she has never alluded to Mr Holbrook again, although the book
he gave her lies with her Bible on the little table by her
bedside.&nbsp; She did not think I heard her when she asked the
little milliner of Cranford to make her caps something like the
Honourable Mrs Jamieson&rsquo;s, or that I noticed the
reply&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she wears widows&rsquo; caps,
ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&nbsp; I only meant something in that style; not
widows&rsquo;, of course, but rather like Mrs
Jamieson&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This effort at concealment was the beginning of the tremulous
motion of head and hands which I have seen ever since in Miss
Matty.</p>
<p>The evening of the day on which we heard of Mr
Holbrook&rsquo;s death, Miss Matilda was very silent and
thoughtful; after prayers she called Martha back and then she
stood uncertain what to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Martha!&rdquo; she said, at last, &ldquo;you are
young&rdquo;&mdash;and then she made so long a pause that Martha,
to remind her of her half-finished sentence, dropped a curtsey,
and said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, please, ma&rsquo;am; two-and-twenty last third of
October, please, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, perhaps, Martha, you may some time meet with a
young man you like, and who likes you.&nbsp; I did say you were
not to have followers; but if you meet with such a young man, and
tell me, and I find he is respectable, I have no objection to his
coming to see you once a week.&nbsp; God forbid!&rdquo; said she
in a low voice, &ldquo;that I should grieve any young
hearts.&rdquo;&nbsp; She spoke as if she were providing for some
distant <a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
64</span>contingency, and was rather startled when Martha made
her ready eager answer&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, ma&rsquo;am, there&rsquo;s Jem Hearn, and
he&rsquo;s a joiner making three-and-sixpence a-day, and six foot
one in his stocking-feet, please, ma&rsquo;am; and if
you&rsquo;ll ask about him to-morrow morning, every one will give
him a character for steadiness; and he&rsquo;ll be glad enough to
come to-morrow night, I&rsquo;ll be bound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though Miss Matty was startled, she submitted to Fate and
Love.</p>
<h2><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
65</span>CHAPTER V&mdash;OLD LETTERS</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">have</span> often noticed that almost
every one has his own individual small economies&mdash;careful
habits of saving fractions of pennies in some one peculiar
direction&mdash;any disturbance of which annoys him more than
spending shillings or pounds on some real extravagance.&nbsp; An
old gentleman of my acquaintance, who took the intelligence of
the failure of a Joint-Stock Bank, in which some of his money was
invested, with stoical mildness, worried his family all through a
long summer&rsquo;s day because one of them had torn (instead of
cutting) out the written leaves of his now useless bank-book; of
course, the corresponding pages at the other end came out as
well, and this little unnecessary waste of paper (his private
economy) chafed him more than all the loss of his money.&nbsp;
Envelopes fretted his soul terribly when they first came in; the
only way in which he could reconcile himself to such waste of his
cherished article was by patiently turning inside out all that
were sent to him, and so making them serve again.&nbsp; Even now,
though tamed by age, I see him casting wistful glances at his
daughters when they send a <a name="page66"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 66</span>whole inside of a half-sheet of note
paper, with the three lines of acceptance to an invitation,
written on only one of the sides.&nbsp; I am not above owning
that I have this human weakness myself.&nbsp; String is my
foible.&nbsp; My pockets get full of little hanks of it, picked
up and twisted together, ready for uses that never come.&nbsp; I
am seriously annoyed if any one cuts the string of a parcel
instead of patiently and faithfully undoing it fold by
fold.&nbsp; How people can bring themselves to use india-rubber
rings, which are a sort of deification of string, as lightly as
they do, I cannot imagine.&nbsp; To me an india-rubber ring is a
precious treasure.&nbsp; I have one which is not new&mdash;one
that I picked up off the floor nearly six years ago.&nbsp; I have
really tried to use it, but my heart failed me, and I could not
commit the extravagance.</p>
<p>Small pieces of butter grieve others.&nbsp; They cannot attend
to conversation because of the annoyance occasioned by the habit
which some people have of invariably taking more butter than they
want.&nbsp; Have you not seen the anxious look (almost mesmeric)
which such persons fix on the article?&nbsp; They would feel it a
relief if they might bury it out of their sight by popping it
into their own mouths and swallowing it down; and they are really
made happy if the person on whose plate it lies unused suddenly
breaks off a piece of toast (which he does not want at all) and
eats up his butter.&nbsp; They think that this is not waste.</p>
<p>Now Miss Matty Jenkyns was chary of candles.&nbsp; We had many
devices to use as few as possible.&nbsp; In the winter afternoons
she would sit knitting for two or three hours&mdash;she could do
this in the dark, or by <a name="page67"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 67</span>firelight&mdash;and when I asked if I
might not ring for candles to finish stitching my wristbands, she
told me to &ldquo;keep blind man&rsquo;s holiday.&rdquo;&nbsp;
They were usually brought in with tea; but we only burnt one at a
time.&nbsp; As we lived in constant preparation for a friend who
might come in any evening (but who never did), it required some
contrivance to keep our two candles of the same length, ready to
be lighted, and to look as if we burnt two always.&nbsp; The
candles took it in turns; and, whatever we might be talking about
or doing, Miss Matty&rsquo;s eyes were habitually fixed upon the
candle, ready to jump up and extinguish it and to light the other
before they had become too uneven in length to be restored to
equality in the course of the evening.</p>
<p>One night, I remember this candle economy particularly annoyed
me.&nbsp; I had been very much tired of my compulsory
&ldquo;blind man&rsquo;s holiday,&rdquo; especially as Miss Matty
had fallen asleep, and I did not like to stir the fire and run
the risk of awakening her; so I could not even sit on the rug,
and scorch myself with sewing by firelight, according to my usual
custom.&nbsp; I fancied Miss Matty must be dreaming of her early
life; for she spoke one or two words in her uneasy sleep bearing
reference to persons who were dead long before.&nbsp; When Martha
brought in the lighted candle and tea, Miss Matty started into
wakefulness, with a strange, bewildered look around, as if we
were not the people she expected to see about her.&nbsp; There
was a little sad expression that shadowed her face as she
recognised me; but immediately afterwards she tried to give me
her usual smile.&nbsp; All through tea-time her talk ran <a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>upon the days
of her childhood and youth.&nbsp; Perhaps this reminded her of
the desirableness of looking over all the old family letters, and
destroying such as ought not to be allowed to fall into the hands
of strangers; for she had often spoken of the necessity of this
task, but had always shrunk from it, with a timid dread of
something painful.&nbsp; To-night, however, she rose up after tea
and went for them&mdash;in the dark; for she piqued herself on
the precise neatness of all her chamber arrangements, and used to
look uneasily at me when I lighted a bed-candle to go to another
room for anything.&nbsp; When she returned there was a faint,
pleasant smell of Tonquin beans in the room.&nbsp; I had always
noticed this scent about any of the things which had belonged to
her mother; and many of the letters were addressed to
her&mdash;yellow bundles of love-letters, sixty or seventy years
old.</p>
<p>Miss Matty undid the packet with a sigh; but she stifled it
directly, as if it were hardly right to regret the flight of
time, or of life either.&nbsp; We agreed to look them over
separately, each taking a different letter out of the same bundle
and describing its contents to the other before destroying
it.&nbsp; I never knew what sad work the reading of old-letters
was before that evening, though I could hardly tell why.&nbsp;
The letters were as happy as letters could be&mdash;at least
those early letters were.&nbsp; There was in them a vivid and
intense sense of the present time, which seemed so strong and
full, as if it could never pass away, and as if the warm, living
hearts that so expressed themselves could never die, and be as
nothing to the sunny earth.&nbsp; I should have felt less
melancholy, I believe, if the letters had been more so.&nbsp; <a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>I saw the
tears stealing down the well-worn furrows of Miss Matty&rsquo;s
cheeks, and her spectacles often wanted wiping.&nbsp; I trusted
at last that she would light the other candle, for my own eyes
were rather dim, and I wanted more light to see the pale, faded
ink; but no, even through her tears, she saw and remembered her
little economical ways.</p>
<p>The earliest set of letters were two bundles tied together,
and ticketed (in Miss Jenkyns&rsquo;s handwriting) &ldquo;Letters
interchanged between my ever-honoured father and my
dearly-beloved mother, prior to their marriage, in July
1774.&rdquo;&nbsp; I should guess that the rector of Cranford was
about twenty-seven years of age when he wrote those letters; and
Miss Matty told me that her mother was just eighteen at the time
of her wedding.&nbsp; With my idea of the rector derived from a
picture in the dining-parlour, stiff and stately, in a huge
full-bottomed wig, with gown, cassock, and bands, and his hand
upon a copy of the only sermon he ever published&mdash;it was
strange to read these letters.&nbsp; They were full of eager,
passionate ardour; short homely sentences, right fresh from the
heart (very different from the grand Latinised, Johnsonian style
of the printed sermon preached before some judge at assize
time).&nbsp; His letters were a curious contrast to those of his
girl-bride.&nbsp; She was evidently rather annoyed at his demands
upon her for expressions of love, and could not quite understand
what he meant by repeating the same thing over in so many
different ways; but what she was quite clear about was a longing
for a white &ldquo;Paduasoy&rdquo;&mdash;whatever that might be;
and six or seven letters were principally occupied in asking her
<a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>lover to
use his influence with her parents (who evidently kept her in
good order) to obtain this or that article of dress, more
especially the white &ldquo;Paduasoy.&rdquo;&nbsp; He cared
nothing how she was dressed; she was always lovely enough for
him, as he took pains to assure her, when she begged him to
express in his answers a predilection for particular pieces of
finery, in order that she might show what he said to her
parents.&nbsp; But at length he seemed to find out that she would
not be married till she had a &ldquo;trousseau&rdquo; to her
mind; and then he sent her a letter, which had evidently
accompanied a whole box full of finery, and in which he requested
that she might be dressed in everything her heart desired.&nbsp;
This was the first letter, ticketed in a frail, delicate hand,
&ldquo;From my dearest John.&rdquo;&nbsp; Shortly afterwards they
were married, I suppose, from the intermission in their
correspondence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must burn them, I think,&rdquo; said Miss Matty,
looking doubtfully at me.&nbsp; &ldquo;No one will care for them
when I am gone.&rdquo;&nbsp; And one by one she dropped them into
the middle of the fire, watching each blaze up, die out, and rise
away, in faint, white, ghostly semblance, up the chimney, before
she gave another to the same fate.&nbsp; The room was light
enough now; but I, like her, was fascinated into watching the
destruction of those letters, into which the honest warmth of a
manly heart had been poured forth.</p>
<p>The next letter, likewise docketed by Miss Jenkyns, was
endorsed, &ldquo;Letter of pious congratulation and exhortation
from my venerable grandfather to my beloved mother, on occasion
of my own birth.&nbsp; <a name="page71"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 71</span>Also some practical remarks on the
desirability of keeping warm the extremities of infants, from my
excellent grandmother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first part was, indeed, a severe and forcible picture of
the responsibilities of mothers, and a warning against the evils
that were in the world, and lying in ghastly wait for the little
baby of two days old.&nbsp; His wife did not write, said the old
gentleman, because he had forbidden it, she being indisposed with
a sprained ankle, which (he said) quite incapacitated her from
holding a pen.&nbsp; However, at the foot of the page was a small
&ldquo;T.O.,&rdquo; and on turning it over, sure enough, there
was a letter to &ldquo;my dear, dearest Molly,&rdquo; begging
her, when she left her room, whatever she did, to go <i>up</i>
stairs before going <i>down</i>: and telling her to wrap her
baby&rsquo;s feet up in flannel, and keep it warm by the fire,
although it was summer, for babies were so tender.</p>
<p>It was pretty to see from the letters, which were evidently
exchanged with some frequency between the young mother and the
grandmother, how the girlish vanity was being weeded out of her
heart by love for her baby.&nbsp; The white
&ldquo;Paduasoy&rdquo; figured again in the letters, with almost
as much vigour as before.&nbsp; In one, it was being made into a
christening cloak for the baby.&nbsp; It decked it when it went
with its parents to spend a day or two at Arley Hall.&nbsp; It
added to its charms, when it was &ldquo;the prettiest little baby
that ever was seen.&nbsp; Dear mother, I wish you could see
her!&nbsp; Without any pershality, I do think she will grow up a
regular bewty!&rdquo;&nbsp; I thought of Miss Jenkyns, grey,
withered, and wrinkled, and I wondered if her mother had known
her in the courts <a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
72</span>of heaven: and then I knew that she had, and that they
stood there in angelic guise.</p>
<p>There was a great gap before any of the rector&rsquo;s letters
appeared.&nbsp; And then his wife had changed her mode of her
endorsement.&nbsp; It was no longer from, &ldquo;My dearest
John;&rdquo; it was from &ldquo;My Honoured Husband.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The letters were written on occasion of the publication of the
same sermon which was represented in the picture.&nbsp; The
preaching before &ldquo;My Lord Judge,&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;publishing by request,&rdquo; was evidently the
culminating point&mdash;the event of his life.&nbsp; It had been
necessary for him to go up to London to superintend it through
the press.&nbsp; Many friends had to be called upon and consulted
before he could decide on any printer fit for so onerous a task;
and at length it was arranged that J. and J. Rivingtons were to
have the honourable responsibility.&nbsp; The worthy rector
seemed to be strung up by the occasion to a high literary pitch,
for he could hardly write a letter to his wife without cropping
out into Latin.&nbsp; I remember the end of one of his letters
ran thus: &ldquo;I shall ever hold the virtuous qualities of my
Molly in remembrance, <i>dum memor ipse mei</i>, <i>dum spiritus
regit artus</i>,&rdquo; which, considering that the English of
his correspondent was sometimes at fault in grammar, and often in
spelling, might be taken as a proof of how much he
&ldquo;idealised his Molly;&rdquo; and, as Miss Jenkyns used to
say, &ldquo;People talk a great deal about idealising now-a-days,
whatever that may mean.&rdquo;&nbsp; But this was nothing to a
fit of writing classical poetry which soon seized him, in which
his Molly figured away as &ldquo;Maria.&rdquo;&nbsp; The letter
containing the <i>carmen</i> was endorsed by her, &ldquo;Hebrew
verses sent me by <a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>my honoured husband.&nbsp; I thowt to have had a letter
about killing the pig, but must wait.&nbsp; Mem., to send the
poetry to Sir Peter Arley, as my husband desires.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And in a post-scriptum note in his handwriting it was stated that
the Ode had appeared in the <i>Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine</i>,
December 1782.</p>
<p>Her letters back to her husband (treasured as fondly by him as
if they had been <i>M. T. Ciceronis Epistol&aelig;</i>) were more
satisfactory to an absent husband and father than his could ever
have been to her.&nbsp; She told him how Deborah sewed her seam
very neatly every day, and read to her in the books he had set
her; how she was a very &ldquo;forrard,&rdquo; good child, but
would ask questions her mother could not answer, but how she did
not let herself down by saying she did not know, but took to
stirring the fire, or sending the &ldquo;forrard&rdquo; child on
an errand.&nbsp; Matty was now the mother&rsquo;s darling, and
promised (like her sister at her age), to be a great
beauty.&nbsp; I was reading this aloud to Miss Matty, who smiled
and sighed a little at the hope, so fondly expressed, that
&ldquo;little Matty might not be vain, even if she were a
bewty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had very pretty hair, my dear,&rdquo; said Miss
Matilda; &ldquo;and not a bad mouth.&rdquo;&nbsp; And I saw her
soon afterwards adjust her cap and draw herself up.</p>
<p>But to return to Mrs Jenkyns&rsquo;s letters.&nbsp; She told
her husband about the poor in the parish; what homely domestic
medicines she had administered; what kitchen physic she had
sent.&nbsp; She had evidently held his displeasure as a rod in
pickle over the heads of all the ne&rsquo;er-do-wells.&nbsp; She
asked for his directions <a name="page74"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 74</span>about the cows and pigs; and did not
always obtain them, as I have shown before.</p>
<p>The kind old grandmother was dead when a little boy was born,
soon after the publication of the sermon; but there was another
letter of exhortation from the grandfather, more stringent and
admonitory than ever, now that there was a boy to be guarded from
the snares of the world.&nbsp; He described all the various sins
into which men might fall, until I wondered how any man ever came
to a natural death.&nbsp; The gallows seemed as if it must have
been the termination of the lives of most of the
grandfather&rsquo;s friends and acquaintance; and I was not
surprised at the way in which he spoke of this life being
&ldquo;a vale of tears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seemed curious that I should never have heard of this
brother before; but I concluded that he had died young, or else
surely his name would have been alluded to by his sisters.</p>
<p>By-and-by we came to packets of Miss Jenkyns&rsquo;s
letters.&nbsp; These Miss Matty did regret to burn.&nbsp; She
said all the others had been only interesting to those who loved
the writers, and that it seemed as if it would have hurt her to
allow them to fall into the hands of strangers, who had not known
her dear mother, and how good she was, although she did not
always spell, quite in the modern fashion; but Deborah&rsquo;s
letters were so very superior!&nbsp; Any one might profit by
reading them.&nbsp; It was a long time since she had read Mrs
Chapone, but she knew she used to think that Deborah could have
said the same things quite as well; and as for Mrs Carter! people
thought a deal of her letters, just because she had <a
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>written
&ldquo;Epictetus,&rdquo; but she was quite sure Deborah would
never have made use of such a common expression as &ldquo;I canna
be fashed!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>Miss Matty did grudge burning these letters, it was
evident.&nbsp; She would not let them be carelessly passed over
with any quiet reading, and skipping, to myself.&nbsp; She took
them from me, and even lighted the second candle in order to read
them aloud with a proper emphasis, and without stumbling over the
big words.&nbsp; Oh dear! how I wanted facts instead of
reflections, before those letters were concluded!&nbsp; They
lasted us two nights; and I won&rsquo;t deny that I made use of
the time to think of many other things, and yet I was always at
my post at the end of each sentence.</p>
<p>The rector&rsquo;s letters, and those of his wife and
mother-in-law, had all been tolerably short and pithy, written in
a straight hand, with the lines very close together.&nbsp;
Sometimes the whole letter was contained on a mere scrap of
paper.&nbsp; The paper was very yellow, and the ink very brown;
some of the sheets were (as Miss Matty made me observe) the old
original post, with the stamp in the corner representing a
post-boy riding for life and twanging his horn.&nbsp; The letters
of Mrs Jenkyns and her mother were fastened with a great round
red wafer; for it was before Miss Edgeworth&rsquo;s
&ldquo;patronage&rdquo; had banished wafers from polite
society.&nbsp; It was evident, from the tenor of what was said,
that franks were in great request, and were even used as a means
of paying debts by needy members of Parliament.&nbsp; The rector
sealed his epistles with an immense coat of arms, and showed by
the care with which he had performed this <a
name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>ceremony that
he expected they should be cut open, not broken by any
thoughtless or impatient hand.&nbsp; Now, Miss Jenkyns&rsquo;s
letters were of a later date in form and writing.&nbsp; She wrote
on the square sheet which we have learned to call
old-fashioned.&nbsp; Her hand was admirably calculated, together
with her use of many-syllabled words, to fill up a sheet, and
then came the pride and delight of crossing.&nbsp; Poor Miss
Matty got sadly puzzled with this, for the words gathered size
like snowballs, and towards the end of her letter Miss Jenkyns
used to become quite sesquipedalian.&nbsp; In one to her father,
slightly theological and controversial in its tone, she had
spoken of Herod, Tetrarch of Idumea.&nbsp; Miss Matty read it
&ldquo;Herod Petrarch of Etruria,&rdquo; and was just as well
pleased as if she had been right.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t quite remember the date, but I think it was in
1805 that Miss Jenkyns wrote the longest series of
letters&mdash;on occasion of her absence on a visit to some
friends near Newcastle-upon-Tyne.&nbsp; These friends were
intimate with the commandant of the garrison there, and heard
from him of all the preparations that were being made to repel
the invasion of Buonaparte, which some people imagined might take
place at the mouth of the Tyne.&nbsp; Miss Jenkyns was evidently
very much alarmed; and the first part of her letters was often
written in pretty intelligible English, conveying particulars of
the preparations which were made in the family with whom she was
residing against the dreaded event; the bundles of clothes that
were packed up ready for a flight to Alston Moor (a wild hilly
piece of ground between Northumberland and Cumberland); the
signal that <a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
77</span>was to be given for this flight, and for the
simultaneous turning out of the volunteers under arms&mdash;which
said signal was to consist (if I remember rightly) in ringing the
church bells in a particular and ominous manner.&nbsp; One day,
when Miss Jenkyns and her hosts were at a dinner-party in
Newcastle, this warning summons was actually given (not a very
wise proceeding, if there be any truth in the moral attached to
the fable of the Boy and the Wolf; but so it was), and Miss
Jenkyns, hardly recovered from her fright, wrote the next day to
describe the sound, the breathless shock, the hurry and alarm;
and then, taking breath, she added, &ldquo;How trivial, my dear
father, do all our apprehensions of the last evening appear, at
the present moment, to calm and enquiring minds!&rdquo;&nbsp; And
here Miss Matty broke in with&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, indeed, my dear, they were not at all trivial or
trifling at the time.&nbsp; I know I used to wake up in the night
many a time and think I heard the tramp of the French entering
Cranford.&nbsp; Many people talked of hiding themselves in the
salt mines&mdash;and meat would have kept capitally down there,
only perhaps we should have been thirsty.&nbsp; And my father
preached a whole set of sermons on the occasion; one set in the
mornings, all about David and Goliath, to spirit up the people to
fighting with spades or bricks, if need were; and the other set
in the afternoons, proving that Napoleon (that was another name
for Bony, as we used to call him) was all the same as an Apollyon
and Abaddon.&nbsp; I remember my father rather thought he should
be asked to print this last set; but the parish had, perhaps, had
enough of them with hearing.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>Peter
Marmaduke Arley Jenkyns (&ldquo;poor Peter!&rdquo; as Miss Matty
began to call him) was at school at Shrewsbury by this
time.&nbsp; The rector took up his pen, and rubbed up his Latin
once more, to correspond with his boy.&nbsp; It was very clear
that the lad&rsquo;s were what are called show letters.&nbsp;
They were of a highly mental description, giving an account of
his studies, and his intellectual hopes of various kinds, with an
occasional quotation from the classics; but, now and then, the
animal nature broke out in such a little sentence as this,
evidently written in a trembling hurry, after the letter had been
inspected: &ldquo;Mother dear, do send me a cake, and put plenty
of citron in.&rdquo;&nbsp; The &ldquo;mother dear&rdquo; probably
answered her boy in the form of cakes and &ldquo;goody,&rdquo;
for there were none of her letters among this set; but a whole
collection of the rector&rsquo;s, to whom the Latin in his
boy&rsquo;s letters was like a trumpet to the old
war-horse.&nbsp; I do not know much about Latin, certainly, and
it is, perhaps, an ornamental language, but not very useful, I
think&mdash;at least to judge from the bits I remember out of the
rector&rsquo;s letters.&nbsp; One was, &ldquo;You have not got
that town in your map of Ireland; but <i>Bonus Bernardus non
videt omnia</i>, as the Proverbia say.&rdquo;&nbsp; Presently it
became very evident that &ldquo;poor Peter&rdquo; got himself
into many scrapes.&nbsp; There were letters of stilted penitence
to his father, for some wrong-doing; and among them all was a
badly-written, badly-sealed, badly-directed, blotted
note:&mdash;&ldquo;My dear, dear, dear, dearest mother, I will be
a better boy; I will, indeed; but don&rsquo;t, please, be ill for
me; I am not worth it; but I will be good, darling
mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>Miss
Matty could not speak for crying, after she had read this
note.&nbsp; She gave it to me in silence, and then got up and
took it to her sacred recesses in her own room, for fear, by any
chance, it might get burnt.&nbsp; &ldquo;Poor Peter!&rdquo; she
said; &ldquo;he was always in scrapes; he was too easy.&nbsp;
They led him wrong, and then left him in the lurch.&nbsp; But he
was too fond of mischief.&nbsp; He could never resist a
joke.&nbsp; Poor Peter!&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
80</span>CHAPTER VI&mdash;POOR PETER</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Poor</span> Peter&rsquo;s career lay
before him rather pleasantly mapped out by kind friends, but
<i>Bonus Bernardus non videt omnia</i>, in this map too.&nbsp; He
was to win honours at the Shrewsbury School, and carry them thick
to Cambridge, and after that, a living awaited him, the gift of
his godfather, Sir Peter Arley.&nbsp; Poor Peter! his lot in life
was very different to what his friends had hoped and
planned.&nbsp; Miss Matty told me all about it, and I think it
was a relief when she had done so.</p>
<p>He was the darling of his mother, who seemed to dote on all
her children, though she was, perhaps, a little afraid of
Deborah&rsquo;s superior acquirements.&nbsp; Deborah was the
favourite of her father, and when Peter disappointed him, she
became his pride.&nbsp; The sole honour Peter brought away from
Shrewsbury was the reputation of being the best good fellow that
ever was, and of being the captain of the school in the art of
practical joking.&nbsp; His father was disappointed, but set
about remedying the matter in a manly way.&nbsp; He could not
afford to send Peter to read with any tutor, but he could read
with <a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>him
himself; and Miss Matty told me much of the awful preparations in
the way of dictionaries and lexicons that were made in her
father&rsquo;s study the morning Peter began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My poor mother!&rdquo; said she.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
remember how she used to stand in the hall, just near enough the
study-door, to catch the tone of my father&rsquo;s voice.&nbsp; I
could tell in a moment if all was going right, by her face.&nbsp;
And it did go right for a long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What went wrong at last?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That tiresome Latin, I dare say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! it was not the Latin.&nbsp; Peter was in high
favour with my father, for he worked up well for him.&nbsp; But
he seemed to think that the Cranford people might be joked about,
and made fun of, and they did not like it; nobody does.&nbsp; He
was always hoaxing them; &lsquo;hoaxing&rsquo; is not a pretty
word, <a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>my
dear, and I hope you won&rsquo;t tell your father I used it, for
I should not like him to think that I was not choice in my
language, after living with such a woman as Deborah.&nbsp; And be
sure you never use it yourself.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know how it
slipped out of my mouth, except it was that I was thinking of
poor Peter and it was always his expression.&nbsp; But he was a
very gentlemanly boy in many things.&nbsp; He was like dear
Captain Brown in always being ready to help any old person or a
child.&nbsp; Still, he did like joking and making fun; and he
seemed to think the old ladies in Cranford would believe
anything.&nbsp; There were many old ladies living here then; we
are principally ladies now, I know, but we are not so old as the
ladies used to be when I was a girl.&nbsp; I could laugh to think
of some of Peter&rsquo;s jokes.&nbsp; No, my dear, I won&rsquo;t
tell you of them, because they might not shock you as they ought
to do, and they were very shocking.&nbsp; He even took in my
father once, by dressing himself up as a lady that was passing
through the town and wished to see the Rector of Cranford,
&lsquo;who had published that admirable Assize
Sermon.&rsquo;&nbsp; Peter said he was awfully frightened himself
when he saw how my father took it all in, and even offered to
copy out all his Napoleon Buonaparte sermons for her&mdash;him, I
mean&mdash;no, her, for Peter was a lady then.&nbsp; He told me
he was more terrified than he ever was before, all the time my
father was speaking.&nbsp; He did not think my father would have
believed him; and yet if he had not, it would have been a sad
thing for Peter.&nbsp; As it was, he was none so glad of it, for
my father kept him hard at work copying out all those twelve
Buonaparte sermons for the lady&mdash;that was for Peter himself,
you know.&nbsp; He was the lady.&nbsp; And once when he wanted to
go fishing, Peter said, &lsquo;Confound the
woman!&rsquo;&mdash;very bad language, my dear, but Peter was not
always so guarded as he should have been; my father was so angry
with him, it nearly frightened me out of my wits: and yet I could
hardly keep from laughing at the little curtseys Peter kept
making, quite slyly, whenever my father spoke of the lady&rsquo;s
excellent taste and sound discrimination.&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Miss Jenkyns know of these tricks?&rdquo; said
I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&nbsp; Deborah would have been too much
shocked.&nbsp; No, no one knew but me.&nbsp; I wish I had always
known of Peter&rsquo;s plans; but sometimes he did not tell
me.&nbsp; He used to say the old ladies in <a
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>the town
wanted something to talk about; but I don&rsquo;t think they
did.&nbsp; They had the <i>St James&rsquo;s Chronicle</i> three
times a week, just as we have now, and we have plenty to say; and
I remember the clacking noise there always was when some of the
ladies got together.&nbsp; But, probably, schoolboys talk more
than ladies.&nbsp; At last there was a terrible, sad thing
happened.&rdquo;&nbsp; Miss Matty got up, went to the door, and
opened it; no one was there.&nbsp; She rang the bell for Martha,
and when Martha came, her mistress told her to go for eggs to a
farm at the other end of the town.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will lock the door after you, Martha.&nbsp; You are
not afraid to go, are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, ma&rsquo;am, not at all; Jem Hearn will be only too
proud to go with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Matty drew herself up, and as soon as we were alone, she
wished that Martha had more maidenly reserve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll put out the candle, my dear.&nbsp; We can
talk just as well by firelight, you know.&nbsp; There!&nbsp;
Well, you see, Deborah had gone from home for a fortnight or so;
it was a very still, quiet day, I remember, overhead; and the
lilacs were all in flower, so I suppose it was spring.&nbsp; My
father had gone out to see some sick people in the parish; I
recollect seeing him leave the house with his wig and shovel-hat
and cane.&nbsp; What possessed our poor Peter I don&rsquo;t know;
he had the sweetest temper, and yet he always seemed to like to
plague Deborah.&nbsp; She never laughed at his jokes, and thought
him ungenteel, and not careful enough about improving his mind;
and that vexed him.</p>
<p><a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
84</span>&ldquo;Well! he went to her room, it seems, and dressed
himself in her old gown, and shawl, and bonnet; just the things
she used to wear in Cranford, and was known by everywhere; and he
made the pillow into a little&mdash;you are sure you locked the
door, my dear, for I should not like anyone to
hear&mdash;into&mdash;into a little baby, with white long
clothes.&nbsp; It was only, as he told me afterwards, to make
something to talk about in the town; he never thought of it as
affecting Deborah.&nbsp; And he went and walked up and down in
the Filbert walk&mdash;just half-hidden by the rails, and
half-seen; and he cuddled his pillow, just like a baby, and
talked to it all the nonsense people do.&nbsp; Oh dear! and my
father came stepping stately up the street, as he always did; and
what should he see but a little black crowd of people&mdash;I
daresay as many as twenty&mdash;all peeping through his garden
rails.&nbsp; So he thought, at first, they were only looking at a
new rhododendron that was in full bloom, and that he was very
proud of; and he walked slower, that they might have more time to
admire.&nbsp; And he wondered if he could make out a sermon from
the occasion, and thought, perhaps, there was some relation
between the rhododendrons and the lilies of the field.&nbsp; My
poor father!&nbsp; When he came nearer, he began to wonder that
they did not see him; but their heads were all so close together,
peeping and peeping!&nbsp; My father was amongst them, meaning,
he said, to ask them to walk into the garden with him, and admire
the beautiful vegetable production, when&mdash;oh, my dear, I
tremble to think of it&mdash;he looked through the rails himself,
and saw&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know what he thought he saw, but old
Clare told me his <a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
85</span>face went quite grey-white with anger, and his eyes
blazed out under his frowning black brows; and he spoke
out&mdash;oh, so terribly!&mdash;and bade them all stop where
they were&mdash;not one of them to go, not one of them to stir a
step; and, swift as light, he was in at the garden door, and down
the Filbert walk, and seized hold of poor Peter, and tore his
clothes off his back&mdash;bonnet, shawl, gown, and all&mdash;and
threw the pillow among the people over the railings: and then he
was very, very angry indeed, and before all the people he lifted
up his cane and flogged Peter!</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear, that boy&rsquo;s trick, on that sunny day,
when all seemed going straight and well, broke my mother&rsquo;s
heart, and changed my father for life.&nbsp; It did,
indeed.&nbsp; Old Clare said, Peter looked as white as my father;
and stood as still as a statue to be flogged; and my father
struck hard!&nbsp; When my father stopped to take breath, Peter
said, &lsquo;Have you done enough, sir?&rsquo; quite hoarsely,
and still standing quite quiet.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know what my
father said&mdash;or if he said anything.&nbsp; But old Clare
said, Peter turned to where the people outside the railing were,
and made them a low bow, as grand and as grave as any gentleman;
and then walked slowly into the house.&nbsp; I was in the
store-room helping my mother to make cowslip wine.&nbsp; I cannot
abide the wine now, nor the scent of the flowers; they turn me
sick and faint, as they did that day, when Peter came in, looking
as haughty as any man&mdash;indeed, looking like a man, not like
a boy.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mother!&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I am come to
say, God bless you for ever.&rsquo;&nbsp; I saw his lips quiver
as he spoke; and I think he durst not say anything more loving,
for the purpose that was in his heart.&nbsp; She <a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>looked at him
rather frightened, and wondering, and asked him what was to
do.&nbsp; He did not smile or speak, but put his arms round her
and kissed her as if he did not know how to leave off; and before
she could speak again, he was gone.&nbsp; We talked it over, and
could not understand it, and she bade me go and seek my father,
and ask what it was all about.&nbsp; I found him walking up and
down, looking very highly displeased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Tell your mother I have flogged Peter, and that
he richly deserved it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I durst not ask any more questions.&nbsp; When I told
my mother, she sat down, quite faint, for a minute.&nbsp; I
remember, a few days after, I saw the poor, withered cowslip
flowers thrown out to the leaf heap, to decay and die
there.&nbsp; There was no making of cowslip wine that year at the
rectory&mdash;nor, indeed, ever after.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Presently my mother went to my father.&nbsp; I know I
thought of Queen Esther and King Ahasuerus; for my mother was
very pretty and delicate-looking, and my father looked as
terrible as King Ahasuerus.&nbsp; Some time after they came out
together; and then my mother told me what had happened, and that
she was going up to Peter&rsquo;s room at my father&rsquo;s
desire&mdash;though she was not to tell Peter this&mdash;to talk
the matter over with him.&nbsp; But no Peter was there.&nbsp; We
looked over the house; no Peter was there!&nbsp; Even my father,
who had not liked to join in the search at first, helped us
before long.&nbsp; The rectory was a very old house&mdash;steps
up into a room, steps down into a room, all through.&nbsp; At
first, my mother went calling low and soft, as if to reassure the
poor <a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>boy,
&lsquo;Peter!&nbsp; Peter, dear! it&rsquo;s only me;&rsquo; but,
by-and-by, as the servants came back from the errands my father
had sent them, in different directions, to find where Peter
was&mdash;as we found he was not in the garden, nor the hayloft,
nor anywhere about&mdash;my mother&rsquo;s cry grew louder and
wilder, Peter!&nbsp; Peter, my darling! where are you?&rsquo; for
then she felt and understood that that long kiss meant some sad
kind of &lsquo;good-bye.&rsquo;&nbsp; The afternoon went
on&mdash;my mother never resting, but seeking again and again in
every possible place that had been looked into twenty times
before, nay, that she had looked into over and over again
herself.&nbsp; My father sat with his head in his hands, not
speaking except when his messengers came in, bringing no tidings;
then he lifted up his face, so strong and sad, and told them to
go again in some new direction.&nbsp; My mother kept passing from
room to room, in and out of the house, moving noiselessly, but
never ceasing.&nbsp; Neither she nor my father durst leave the
house, which was the meeting-place for all the messengers.&nbsp;
At last (and it was nearly dark), my father rose up.&nbsp; He
took hold of my mother&rsquo;s arm as she came with wild, sad
pace through one door, and quickly towards another.&nbsp; She
started at the touch of his hand, for she had forgotten all in
the world but Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Molly!&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;I did not think
all this would happen.&rsquo;&nbsp; He looked into her face for
comfort&mdash;her poor face all wild and white; for neither she
nor my father had dared to acknowledge&mdash;much less act
upon&mdash;the terror that was in their hearts, lest Peter should
have made away with himself.&nbsp; My father saw no conscious
look in his wife&rsquo;s hot, dreary <a name="page88"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 88</span>eyes, and he missed the sympathy that
she had always been ready to give him&mdash;strong man as he was,
and at the dumb despair in her face his tears began to
flow.&nbsp; But when she saw this, a gentle sorrow came over her
countenance, and she said, &lsquo;Dearest John! don&rsquo;t cry;
come with me, and we&rsquo;ll find him,&rsquo; almost as
cheerfully as if she knew where he was.&nbsp; And she took my
father&rsquo;s great hand in her little soft one, and led him
along, the tears dropping as he walked on that same unceasing,
weary walk, from room to room, through house and garden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how I wished for Deborah!&nbsp; I had no time for
crying, for now all seemed to depend on me.&nbsp; I wrote for
Deborah to come home.&nbsp; I sent a message privately to that
same Mr Holbrook&rsquo;s house&mdash;poor Mr Holbrook;&mdash;you
know who I mean.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t mean I sent a message to
him, but I sent one that I could trust to know if Peter was at
his house.&nbsp; For at one time Mr Holbrook was an occasional
visitor at the rectory&mdash;you know he was Miss Pole&rsquo;s
cousin&mdash;and he had been very kind to Peter, and taught him
how to fish&mdash;he was very kind to everybody, and I thought
Peter might have gone off there.&nbsp; But Mr Holbrook was from
home, and Peter had never been seen.&nbsp; It was night now; but
the doors were all wide open, and my father and mother walked on
and on; it was more than an hour since he had joined her, and I
don&rsquo;t believe they had ever spoken all that time.&nbsp; I
was getting the parlour fire lighted, and one of the servants was
preparing tea, for I wanted them to have something to eat and
drink and warm them, when old Clare asked to speak to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I have borrowed the nets from the weir, Miss <a
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>Matty.&nbsp;
Shall we drag the ponds to-night, or wait for the
morning?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember staring in his face to gather his meaning;
and when I did, I laughed out loud.&nbsp; The horror of that new
thought&mdash;our bright, darling Peter, cold, and stark, and
dead!&nbsp; I remember the ring of my own laugh now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The next day Deborah was at home before I was myself
again.&nbsp; She would not have been so weak as to give way as I
had done; but my screams (my horrible laughter had ended in
crying) had roused my sweet dear mother, whose poor wandering
wits were called back and collected as soon as a child needed her
care.&nbsp; She and Deborah sat by my bedside; I knew by the
looks of each that there had been no news of Peter&mdash;no
awful, ghastly news, which was what I most had dreaded in my dull
state between sleeping and waking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same result of all the searching had brought
something of the same relief to my mother, to whom, I am sure,
the thought that Peter might even then be hanging dead in some of
the familiar home places had caused that never-ending walk of
yesterday.&nbsp; Her soft eyes never were the same again after
that; they had always a restless, craving look, as if seeking for
what they could not find.&nbsp; Oh! it was an awful time; coming
down like a thunder-bolt on the still sunny day when the lilacs
were all in bloom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where was Mr Peter?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had made his way to Liverpool; and there was war
then; and some of the king&rsquo;s ships lay off the mouth of the
Mersey; and they were only too <a name="page90"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 90</span>glad to have a fine likely boy such
as him (five foot nine he was), come to offer himself.&nbsp; The
captain wrote to my father, and Peter wrote to my mother.&nbsp;
Stay! those letters will be somewhere here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We lighted the candle, and found the captain&rsquo;s letter
and Peter&rsquo;s too.&nbsp; And we also found a little simple
begging letter from Mrs Jenkyns to Peter, addressed to him at the
house of an old schoolfellow whither she fancied he might have
gone.&nbsp; They had returned it unopened; and unopened it had
remained ever since, having been inadvertently put by among the
other letters of that time.&nbsp; This is it:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My dearest
Peter</span>,&mdash;You did not think we should be so sorry as we
are, I know, or you would never have gone away.&nbsp; You are too
good.&nbsp; Your father sits and sighs till my heart aches to
hear him.&nbsp; He cannot hold up his head for grief; and yet he
only did what he thought was right.&nbsp; Perhaps he has been too
severe, and perhaps I have not been kind enough; but God knows
how we love you, my dear only boy.&nbsp; Don looks so sorry you
are gone.&nbsp; Come back, and make us happy, who love you so
much.&nbsp; I know you will come back.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But Peter did not come back.&nbsp; That spring day was the
last time he ever saw his mother&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; The writer
of the letter&mdash;the last&mdash;the only person who had ever
seen what was written in it, was dead long ago; and I, a
stranger, not born at the time when this occurrence took place,
was the one to open it.</p>
<p>The captain&rsquo;s letter summoned the father and <a
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>mother to
Liverpool instantly, if they wished to see their boy; and, by
some of the wild chances of life, the captain&rsquo;s letter had
been detained somewhere, somehow.</p>
<p>Miss Matty went on, &ldquo;And it was racetime, and all the
post-horses at Cranford were gone to the races; but my father and
mother set off in our own gig&mdash;and oh! my dear, they were
too late&mdash;the ship was gone!&nbsp; And now read
Peter&rsquo;s letter to my mother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was full of love, and sorrow, and pride in his new
profession, and a sore sense of his disgrace in the eyes of the
people at Cranford; but ending with a passionate entreaty that
she would come and see him before he left the Mersey:
&ldquo;Mother; we may go into battle.&nbsp; I hope we shall, and
lick those French: but I must see you again before that
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she was too late,&rdquo; said Miss Matty;
&ldquo;too late!&rdquo;</p>
<p>We sat in silence, pondering on the full meaning of those sad,
sad words.&nbsp; At length I asked Miss Matty to tell me how her
mother bore it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;she was patience
itself.&nbsp; She had never been strong, and this weakened her
terribly.&nbsp; My father used to sit looking at her: far more
sad than she was.&nbsp; He seemed as if he could look at nothing
else when she was by; and he was so humble&mdash;so very gentle
now.&nbsp; He would, perhaps, speak in his old way&mdash;laying
down the law, as it were&mdash;and then, in a minute or two, he
would come round and put his hand on our shoulders, and ask us in
a low voice, if he had said anything to hurt us.&nbsp; I did not
<a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>wonder at
his speaking so to Deborah, for she was so clever; but I could
not bear to hear him talking so to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, you see, he saw what we did not&mdash;that it was
killing my mother.&nbsp; Yes! killing her (put out the candle, my
dear; I can talk better in the dark), for she was but a frail
woman, and ill-fitted to stand the fright and shock she had gone
through; and she would smile at him and comfort him, not in
words, but in her looks and tones, which were always cheerful
when he was there.&nbsp; And she would speak of how she thought
Peter stood a good chance of being admiral very soon&mdash;he was
so brave and clever; and how she thought of seeing him in his
navy uniform, and what sort of hats admirals wore; and how much
more fit he was to be a sailor than a clergyman; and all in that
way, just to make my father think she was quite glad of what came
of that unlucky morning&rsquo;s work, and the flogging which was
always in his mind, as we all knew.&nbsp; But oh, my dear! the
bitter, bitter crying she had when she was alone; and at last, as
she grew weaker, she could not keep her tears in when Deborah or
me was by, and would give us message after message for Peter (his
ship had gone to the Mediterranean, or somewhere down there, and
then he was ordered off to India, and there was no overland route
then); but she still said that no one knew where their death lay
in wait, and that we were not to think hers was near.&nbsp; We
did not think it, but we knew it, as we saw her fading away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my dear, it&rsquo;s very foolish of me, I know,
when in all likelihood I am so near seeing her again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And only think, love! the very day after her <a
name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
93</span>death&mdash;for she did not live quite a twelvemonth
after Peter went away&mdash;the very day after&mdash;came a
parcel for her from India&mdash;from her poor boy.&nbsp; It was a
large, soft, white Indian shawl, with just a little narrow border
all round; just what my mother would have liked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We thought it might rouse my father, for he had sat
with her hand in his all night long; so Deborah took it in to
him, and Peter&rsquo;s letter to her, and all.&nbsp; At first, he
took no notice; and we tried to make a kind of light careless
talk about the shawl, opening it out and admiring it.&nbsp; Then,
suddenly, he got up, and spoke: &lsquo;She shall be buried in
it,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;Peter shall have that comfort; and she
would have liked it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, perhaps it was not reasonable, but what could we
do or say?&nbsp; One gives people in grief their own way.&nbsp;
He took it up and felt it: &lsquo;It is just such a shawl as she
wished for when she was married, and her mother did not give it
her.&nbsp; I did not know of it till after, or she should have
had it&mdash;she should; but she shall have it now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother looked so lovely in her death!&nbsp; She was
always pretty, and now she looked fair, and waxen, and
young&mdash;younger than Deborah, as she stood trembling and
shivering by her.&nbsp; We decked her in the long soft folds; she
lay smiling, as if pleased; and people came&mdash;all Cranford
came&mdash;to beg to see her, for they had loved her dearly, as
well they might; and the countrywomen brought posies; old
Clare&rsquo;s wife brought some white violets and begged they
might lie on her breast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Deborah said to me, the day of my mother&rsquo;s <a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>funeral, that
if she had a hundred offers she never would marry and leave my
father.&nbsp; It was not very likely she would have so
many&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know that she had one; but it was not
less to her credit to say so.&nbsp; She was such a daughter to my
father as I think there never was before or since.&nbsp; His eyes
failed him, and she read book after book, and wrote, and copied,
and was always at his service in any parish business.&nbsp; She
could do many more things than my poor mother could; she even
once wrote a letter to the bishop for my father.&nbsp; But he
missed my mother sorely; the whole parish noticed it.&nbsp; Not
that he was less active; I think he was more so, and more patient
in helping every one.&nbsp; I did all I could to set Deborah at
liberty to be with him; for I knew I was good for little, and
that my best work in the world was to do odd jobs quietly, and
set others at liberty.&nbsp; But my father was a changed
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Mr Peter ever come home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, once.&nbsp; He came home a lieutenant; he did not
get to be admiral.&nbsp; And he and my father were such
friends!&nbsp; My father took him into every house in the parish,
he was so proud of him.&nbsp; He never walked out without
Peter&rsquo;s arm to lean upon.&nbsp; Deborah used to smile (I
don&rsquo;t think we ever laughed again after my mother&rsquo;s
death), and say she was quite put in a corner.&nbsp; Not but what
my father always wanted her when there was letter-writing or
reading to be done, or anything to be settled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo; said I, after a pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Peter went to sea again; and, by-and-by, my father
died, blessing us both, and thanking Deborah for all she had been
to him; and, of course, <a name="page95"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 95</span>our circumstances were changed; and,
instead of living at the rectory, and keeping three maids and a
man, we had to come to this small house, and be content with a
servant-of-all-work; but, as Deborah used to say, we have always
lived genteelly, even if circumstances have compelled us to
simplicity.&nbsp; Poor Deborah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Mr Peter?&rdquo; asked I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, there was some great war in India&mdash;I forget
what they call it&mdash;and we have never heard of Peter since
then.&nbsp; I believe he is dead myself; and it sometimes fidgets
me that we have never put on mourning for him.&nbsp; And then
again, when I sit by myself, and all the house is still, I think
I hear his step coming up the street, and my heart begins to
flutter and beat; but the sound always goes past&mdash;and Peter
never comes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Martha back?&nbsp; No!&nbsp;
<i>I&rsquo;ll</i> go, my dear; I can always find my way in the
dark, you know.&nbsp; And a blow of fresh air at the door will do
my head good, and it&rsquo;s rather got a trick of
aching.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So she pattered off.&nbsp; I had lighted the candle, to give
the room a cheerful appearance against her return.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it Martha?&rdquo; asked I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; And I am rather uncomfortable, for I heard
such a strange noise, just as I was opening the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rsquo; I asked, for her eyes were round with
affright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the street&mdash;just outside&mdash;it sounded
like&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talking?&rdquo; I put in, as she hesitated a
little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! kissing&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

96</span>CHAPTER VII&mdash;VISITING</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">One</span> morning, as Miss Matty and I
sat at our work&mdash;it was before twelve o&rsquo;clock, and
Miss Matty had not changed the cap with yellow ribbons that had
been Miss Jenkyns&rsquo;s best, and which Miss Matty was now
wearing out in private, putting on the one made in imitation of
Mrs Jamieson&rsquo;s at all times when she expected to be
seen&mdash;Martha came up, and asked if Miss Betty Barker might
speak to her mistress.&nbsp; Miss Matty assented, and quickly
disappeared to change the yellow ribbons, while Miss Barker came
upstairs; but, as she had forgotten her spectacles, and was
rather flurried by the unusual time of the visit, I was not
surprised to see her return with one cap on the top of the
other.&nbsp; She was quite unconscious of it herself, and looked
at us, with bland satisfaction.&nbsp; Nor do I think Miss Barker
perceived it; for, putting aside the little circumstance that she
was not so young as she had been, she was very much absorbed in
her errand, which she delivered herself of with an oppressive
modesty that found vent in endless apologies.</p>
<p>Miss Betty Barker was the daughter of the old <a
name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>clerk at
Cranford who had officiated in Mr Jenkyns&rsquo;s time.&nbsp; She
and her sister had had pretty good situations as ladies&rsquo;
maids, and had saved money enough to set up a milliner&rsquo;s
shop, which had been patronised by the ladies in the
neighbourhood.&nbsp; Lady Arley, for instance, would occasionally
give Miss Barkers the pattern of an old cap of hers, which they
immediately copied and circulated among the <i>&eacute;lite</i>
of Cranford.&nbsp; I say the <i>&eacute;lite</i>, for Miss
Barkers had caught the trick of the place, and piqued themselves
upon their &ldquo;aristocratic connection.&rdquo;&nbsp; They
would not sell their caps and ribbons to anyone without a
pedigree.&nbsp; Many a farmer&rsquo;s wife or daughter turned
away huffed from Miss Barkers&rsquo; select millinery, and went
rather to the universal shop, where the profits of brown soap and
moist sugar enabled the proprietor to go straight to (Paris, he
said, until he found his customers too patriotic and John Bullish
to wear what the Mounseers wore) London, where, as he often told
his customers, Queen Adelaide had appeared, only the very week
before, in a cap exactly like the one he showed them, trimmed
with yellow and blue ribbons, and had been complimented by King
William on the becoming nature of her head-dress.</p>
<p>Miss Barkers, who confined themselves to truth, and did not
approve of miscellaneous customers, throve notwithstanding.&nbsp;
They were self-denying, good people.&nbsp; Many a time have I
seen the eldest of them (she that had been maid to Mrs Jamieson)
carrying out some delicate mess to a poor person.&nbsp; They only
aped their betters in having &ldquo;nothing to do&rdquo; with the
class immediately below theirs.&nbsp; And <a
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>when Miss
Barker died, their profits and income were found to be such that
Miss Betty was justified in shutting up shop and retiring from
business.&nbsp; She also (as I think I have before said) set up
her cow; a mark of respectability in Cranford almost as decided
as setting up a gig is among some people.&nbsp; She dressed finer
than any lady in Cranford; and we did not wonder at it; for it
was understood that she was wearing out all the bonnets and caps
and outrageous ribbons which had once formed her
stock-in-trade.&nbsp; It was five or six years since she had
given up shop, so in any other place than Cranford her dress
might have been considered <i>pass&eacute;e</i>.</p>
<p>And now Miss Betty Barker had called to invite Miss Matty to
tea at her house on the following Tuesday.&nbsp; She gave me also
an impromptu invitation, as I happened to be a
visitor&mdash;though I could see she had a little fear lest,
since my father had gone to live in Drumble, he might have
engaged in that &ldquo;horrid cotton trade,&rdquo; and so dragged
his family down out of &ldquo;aristocratic society.&rdquo;&nbsp;
She prefaced this invitation with so many apologies that she
quite excited my curiosity.&nbsp; &ldquo;Her presumption&rdquo;
was to be excused.&nbsp; What had she been doing?&nbsp; She
seemed so over-powered by it I could only think that she had been
writing to Queen Adelaide to ask for a receipt for washing lace;
but the act which she so characterised was only an invitation she
had carried to her sister&rsquo;s former mistress, Mrs
Jamieson.&nbsp; &ldquo;Her former occupation considered, could
Miss Matty excuse the liberty?&rdquo;&nbsp; Ah! thought I, she
has found out that double cap, and is going to rectify Miss
Matty&rsquo;s head-dress.&nbsp; No! it was simply to extend her
invitation <a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
99</span>to Miss Matty and to me.&nbsp; Miss Matty bowed
acceptance; and I wondered that, in the graceful action, she did
not feel the unusual weight and extraordinary height of her
head-dress.&nbsp; But I do not think she did, for she recovered
her balance, and went on talking to Miss Betty in a kind,
condescending manner, very different from the fidgety way she
would have had if she had suspected how singular her appearance
was.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mrs Jamieson is coming, I think you
said?&rdquo; asked Miss Matty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; Mrs Jamieson most kindly and condescendingly
said she would be happy to come.&nbsp; One little stipulation she
made, that she should bring Carlo.&nbsp; I told her that if I had
a weakness, it was for dogs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Miss Pole?&rdquo; questioned Miss Matty, who was
thinking of her pool at Preference, in which Carlo would not be
available as a partner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to ask Miss Pole.&nbsp; Of course, I could
not think of asking her until I had asked you, madam&mdash;the
rector&rsquo;s daughter, madam.&nbsp; Believe me, I do not forget
the situation my father held under yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Mrs Forrester, of course?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Mrs Forrester.&nbsp; I thought, in fact, of going
to her before I went to Miss Pole.&nbsp; Although her
circumstances are changed, madam, she was born at Tyrrell, and we
can never forget her alliance to the Bigges, of Bigelow
Hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Matty cared much more for the little circumstance of her
being a very good card-player.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs Fitz-Adam&mdash;I suppose&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, madam.&nbsp; I must draw a line somewhere.&nbsp; <a
name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>Mrs
Jamieson would not, I think, like to meet Mrs Fitz-Adam.&nbsp; I
have the greatest respect for Mrs Fitz-Adam&mdash;but I cannot
think her fit society for such ladies as Mrs Jamieson and Miss
Matilda Jenkyns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Betty Barker bowed low to Miss Matty, and pursed up her
mouth.&nbsp; She looked at me with sidelong dignity, as much as
to say, although a retired milliner, she was no democrat, and
understood the difference of ranks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I beg you to come as near half-past six to my
little dwelling, as possible, Miss Matilda?&nbsp; Mrs Jamieson
dines at five, but has kindly promised not to delay her visit
beyond that time&mdash;half-past six.&rdquo;&nbsp; And with a
swimming curtsey Miss Betty Barker took her leave.</p>
<p>My prophetic soul foretold a visit that afternoon from Miss
Pole, who usually came to call on Miss Matilda after any
event&mdash;or indeed in sight of any event&mdash;to talk it over
with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Betty told me it was to be a choice and select
few,&rdquo; said Miss Pole, as she and Miss Matty compared
notes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, so she said.&nbsp; Not even Mrs
Fitz-Adam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now Mrs Fitz-Adam was the widowed sister of the Cranford
surgeon, whom I have named before.&nbsp; Their parents were
respectable farmers, content with their station.&nbsp; The name
of these good people was Hoggins.&nbsp; Mr Hoggins was the
Cranford doctor now; we disliked the name and considered it
coarse; but, as Miss Jenkyns said, if he changed it to Piggins it
would not be much better.&nbsp; We had hoped to discover a
relationship between him and that Marchioness of Exeter whose
name was Molly Hoggins; but the <a name="page101"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 101</span>man, careless of his own interests,
utterly ignored and denied any such relationship, although, as
dear Miss Jenkyns had said, he had a sister called Mary, and the
same Christian names were very apt to run in families.</p>
<p>Soon after Miss Mary Hoggins married Mr Fitz-Adam, she
disappeared from the neighbourhood for many years.&nbsp; She did
not move in a sphere in Cranford society sufficiently high to
make any of us care to know what Mr Fitz-Adam was.&nbsp; He died
and was gathered to his fathers without our ever having thought
about him at all.&nbsp; And then Mrs Fitz-Adam reappeared in
Cranford (&ldquo;as bold as a lion,&rdquo; Miss Pole said), a
well-to-do widow, dressed in rustling black silk, so soon after
her husband&rsquo;s death that poor Miss Jenkyns was justified in
the remark she made, that &ldquo;bombazine would have shown a
deeper sense of her loss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I remember the convocation of ladies who assembled to decide
whether or not Mrs Fitz-Adam should be called upon by the old
blue-blooded inhabitants of Cranford.&nbsp; She had taken a large
rambling house, which had been usually considered to confer a
patent of gentility upon its tenant, because, once upon a time,
seventy or eighty years before, the spinster daughter of an earl
had resided in it.&nbsp; I am not sure if the inhabiting this
house was not also believed to convey some unusual power of
intellect; for the earl&rsquo;s daughter, Lady Jane, had a
sister, Lady Anne, who had married a general officer in the time
of the American war, and this general officer had written one or
two comedies, which were still acted on the London boards, and
which, when we saw them advertised, made us all draw up, and feel
that Drury Lane <a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
102</span>was paying a very pretty compliment to Cranford.&nbsp;
Still, it was not at all a settled thing that Mrs Fitz-Adam was
to be visited, when dear Miss Jenkyns died; and, with her,
something of the clear knowledge of the strict code of gentility
went out too.&nbsp; As Miss Pole observed, &ldquo;As most of the
ladies of good family in Cranford were elderly spinsters, or
widows without children, if we did not relax a little, and become
less exclusive, by-and-by we should have no society at
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Forrester continued on the same side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She had always understood that Fitz meant something
aristocratic; there was Fitz-Roy&mdash;she thought that some of
the King&rsquo;s children had been called Fitz-Roy; and there was
Fitz-Clarence, now&mdash;they were the children of dear good King
William the Fourth.&nbsp; Fitz-Adam!&mdash;it was a pretty name,
and she thought it very probably meant &lsquo;Child of
Adam.&rsquo;&nbsp; No one, who had not some good blood in their
veins, would dare to be called Fitz; there was a deal in a
name&mdash;she had had a cousin who spelt his name with two
little ffs&mdash;ffoulkes&mdash;and he always looked down upon
capital letters and said they belonged to lately-invented
families.&nbsp; She had been afraid he would die a bachelor, he
was so very choice.&nbsp; When he met with a Mrs ffarringdon, at
a watering-place, he took to her immediately; and a very pretty
genteel woman she was&mdash;a widow, with a very good fortune;
and &lsquo;my cousin,&rsquo; Mr ffoulkes, married her; and it was
all owing to her two little ffs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Fitz-Adam did not stand a chance of meeting with a Mr
Fitz-anything in Cranford, so that could not have been her motive
for settling <a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span>there.&nbsp; Miss Matty thought it might have been the
hope of being admitted into the society of the place, which would
certainly be a very agreeable rise for <i>ci-devant</i> Miss
Hoggins; and if this had been her hope it would be cruel to
disappoint her.</p>
<p>So everybody called upon Mrs Fitz-Adam&mdash;everybody but Mrs
Jamieson, who used to show how honourable she was by never seeing
Mrs Fitz-Adam when they met at the Cranford parties.&nbsp; There
would be only eight or ten ladies in the room, and Mrs Fitz-Adam
was the largest of all, and she invariably used to stand up when
Mrs Jamieson came in, and curtsey very low to her whenever she
turned in her direction&mdash;so low, in fact, that I think Mrs
Jamieson must have looked at the wall above her, for she never
moved a muscle of her face, no more than if she had not seen
her.&nbsp; Still Mrs Fitz-Adam persevered.</p>
<p>The spring evenings were getting bright and long when three or
four ladies in calashes met at Miss Barker&rsquo;s door.&nbsp; Do
you know what a calash is?&nbsp; It is a covering worn over caps,
not unlike the heads fastened on old-fashioned gigs; but
sometimes it is not quite so large.&nbsp; This kind of head-gear
always made an awful impression on the children in Cranford; and
now two or three left off their play in the quiet sunny little
street, and gathered in wondering silence round Miss Pole, Miss
Matty, and myself.&nbsp; We were silent too, so that we could
hear loud, suppressed whispers inside Miss Barker&rsquo;s house:
&ldquo;Wait, Peggy! wait till I&rsquo;ve run upstairs and washed
my hands.&nbsp; When I cough, open the door; I&rsquo;ll not be a
minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>And,
true enough it was not a minute before we heard a noise, between
a sneeze and a crow; on which the door flew open.&nbsp; Behind it
stood a round-eyed maiden, all aghast at the honourable company
of calashes, who marched in without a word.&nbsp; She recovered
presence of mind enough to usher us into a small room, which had
been the shop, but was now converted into a temporary
dressing-room.&nbsp; There we unpinned and shook ourselves, and
arranged our features before the glass into a sweet and gracious
company-face; and then, bowing backwards with &ldquo;After you,
ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; we allowed Mrs Forrester to take precedence
up the narrow staircase that led to Miss Barker&rsquo;s
drawing-room.&nbsp; There she sat, as stately and composed as
though we had never heard that odd-sounding cough, from which her
throat must have been even then sore and rough.&nbsp; Kind,
gentle, shabbily-dressed Mrs Forrester was immediately conducted
to the second place of honour&mdash;a seat arranged something
like Prince Albert&rsquo;s near the Queen&rsquo;s&mdash;good, but
not so good.&nbsp; The place of pre-eminence was, of course,
reserved for the Honourable Mrs Jamieson, who presently came
panting up the stairs&mdash;Carlo rushing round her on her
progress, as if he meant to trip her up.</p>
<p>And now Miss Betty Barker was a proud and happy woman!&nbsp;
She stirred the fire, and shut the door, and sat as near to it as
she could, quite on the edge of her chair.&nbsp; When Peggy came
in, tottering under the weight of the tea-tray, I noticed that
Miss Barker was sadly afraid lest Peggy should not keep her
distance sufficiently.&nbsp; She and her mistress were on very
familiar terms in their every-day intercourse, <a
name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>and Peggy
wanted now to make several little confidences to her, which Miss
Barker was on thorns to hear, but which she thought it her duty,
as a lady, to repress.&nbsp; So she turned away from all
Peggy&rsquo;s asides and signs; but she made one or two very
malapropos answers to what was said; and at last, seized with a
bright idea, she exclaimed, &ldquo;Poor, sweet Carlo!&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m forgetting him.&nbsp; Come downstairs with me, poor
ittie doggie, and it shall have its tea, it shall!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a few minutes she returned, bland and benignant as before;
but I thought she had forgotten to give the &ldquo;poor ittie
doggie&rdquo; anything to eat, judging by the avidity with which
he swallowed down chance pieces of cake.&nbsp; The tea-tray was
abundantly loaded&mdash;I was pleased to see it, I was so hungry;
but I was afraid the ladies present might think it vulgarly
heaped up.&nbsp; I know they would have done at their own houses;
but somehow the heaps disappeared here.&nbsp; I saw Mrs Jamieson
eating seed-cake, slowly and considerately, as she did
everything; and I was rather surprised, for I knew she had told
us, on the occasion of her last party, that she never had it in
her house, it reminded her so much of scented soap.&nbsp; She
always gave us Savoy biscuits.&nbsp; However, Mrs Jamieson was
kindly indulgent to Miss Barker&rsquo;s want of knowledge of the
customs of high life; and, to spare her feelings, ate three large
pieces of seed-cake, with a placid, ruminating expression of
countenance, not unlike a cow&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>After tea there was some little demur and difficulty.&nbsp; We
were six in number; four could <a name="page106"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 106</span>play at Preference, and for the
other two there was Cribbage.&nbsp; But all, except myself (I was
rather afraid of the Cranford ladies at cards, for it was the
most earnest and serious business they ever engaged in), were
anxious to be of the &ldquo;pool.&rdquo;&nbsp; Even Miss Barker,
while declaring she did not know Spadille from Manille, was
evidently hankering to take a hand.&nbsp; The dilemma was soon
put an end to by a singular kind of noise.&nbsp; If a
baron&rsquo;s daughter-in-law could ever be supposed to snore, I
should have said Mrs Jamieson did so then; for, overcome by the
heat of the room, and inclined to doze by nature, the temptation
of that very comfortable arm-chair had been too much for her, and
Mrs Jamieson was nodding.&nbsp; Once or twice she opened her eyes
with an effort, and calmly but unconsciously smiled upon us; but
by-and-by, even her benevolence was not equal to this exertion,
and she was sound asleep.</p>

</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;It is very gratifying to me,&rdquo; whispered Miss
Barker at the card-table to her three opponents, whom,
notwithstanding her ignorance of the game, she was
&ldquo;basting&rdquo; most unmercifully&mdash;&ldquo;very
gratifying indeed, to see how completely Mrs Jamieson feels at
home in my poor little dwelling; she could not have paid me a
greater compliment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Barker provided me with some literature in the shape of
three or four handsomely-bound fashion-books ten or twelve years
old, observing, as she put a little table and a candle for my
especial benefit, that she knew young people liked to look at
pictures.&nbsp; Carlo lay and snorted, and started at his
mistress&rsquo;s feet.&nbsp; He, too, was quite at home.</p>
<p>The card-table was an animated scene to watch; <a
name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>four
ladies&rsquo; heads, with niddle-noddling caps, all nearly
meeting over the middle of the table in their eagerness to
whisper quick enough and loud enough: and every now and then came
Miss Barker&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hush, ladies! if you please,
hush!&nbsp; Mrs Jamieson is asleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was very difficult to steer clear between Mrs
Forrester&rsquo;s deafness and Mrs Jamieson&rsquo;s
sleepiness.&nbsp; But Miss Barker managed her arduous task
well.&nbsp; She repeated the whisper to Mrs Forrester, distorting
her face considerably, in order to show, by the motions of her
lips, what was said; and then she smiled kindly all round at us,
and murmured to herself, &ldquo;Very gratifying, indeed; I wish
my poor sister had been alive to see this day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Presently the door was thrown wide open; Carlo started to his
feet, with a loud snapping bark, and Mrs Jamieson awoke: or,
perhaps, she had not been asleep&mdash;as she said almost
directly, the room had been so light she had been glad to keep
her eyes shut, but had been listening with great interest to all
our amusing and agreeable conversation.&nbsp; Peggy came in once
more, red with importance.&nbsp; Another tray!&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh,
gentility!&rdquo; thought I, &ldquo;can yon endure this last
shock?&rdquo;&nbsp; For Miss Barker had ordered (nay, I doubt
not, prepared, although she did say, &ldquo;Why, Peggy, what have
you brought us?&rdquo; and looked pleasantly surprised at the
unexpected pleasure) all sorts of good things for
supper&mdash;scalloped oysters, potted lobsters, jelly, a dish
called &ldquo;little Cupids&rdquo; (which was in great favour
with the Cranford ladies, although too expensive to be given,
except on solemn and state occasions&mdash;macaroons sopped in
brandy, I should have called it, if I had not known its more <a
name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>refined and
classical name).&nbsp; In short, we were evidently to be feasted
with all that was sweetest and best; and we thought it better to
submit graciously, even at the cost of our gentility&mdash;which
never ate suppers in general, but which, like most
non-supper-eaters, was particularly hungry on all special
occasions.</p>
<p>Miss Barker, in her former sphere, had, I daresay, been made
acquainted with the beverage they call cherry-brandy.&nbsp; We
none of us had ever seen such a thing, and rather shrank back
when she proffered it us&mdash;&ldquo;just a little, leetle
glass, ladies; after the oysters and lobsters, you know.&nbsp;
Shell-fish are sometimes thought not very wholesome.&rdquo;&nbsp;
We all shook our heads like female mandarins; but, at last, Mrs
Jamieson suffered herself to be persuaded, and we followed her
lead.&nbsp; It was not exactly unpalatable, though so hot and so
strong that we thought ourselves bound to give evidence that we
were not accustomed to such things by coughing
terribly&mdash;almost as strangely as Miss Barker had done,
before we were admitted by Peggy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very strong,&rdquo; said Miss Pole, as she
put down her empty glass; &ldquo;I do believe there&rsquo;s
spirit in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a little drop&mdash;just necessary to make it
keep,&rdquo; said Miss Barker.&nbsp; &ldquo;You know we put
brandy-pepper over our preserves to make them keep.&nbsp; I often
feel tipsy myself from eating damson tart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I question whether damson tart would have opened Mrs
Jamieson&rsquo;s heart as the cherry-brandy did; but she told us
of a coming event, respecting which she had been quite silent
till that moment.</p>
<p><a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
109</span>&ldquo;My sister-in-law, Lady Glenmire, is coming to
stay with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a chorus of &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; and then a
pause.&nbsp; Each one rapidly reviewed her wardrobe, as to its
fitness to appear in the presence of a baron&rsquo;s widow; for,
of course, a series of small festivals were always held in
Cranford on the arrival of a visitor at any of our friends&rsquo;
houses.&nbsp; We felt very pleasantly excited on the present
occasion.</p>
<p>Not long after this the maids and the lanterns were
announced.&nbsp; Mrs Jamieson had the sedan-chair, which had
squeezed itself into Miss Barker&rsquo;s narrow lobby with some
difficulty, and most literally &ldquo;stopped the
way.&rdquo;&nbsp; It required some skilful manoeuvring on the
part of the old chairmen (shoemakers by day, but when summoned to
carry the sedan dressed up in a strange old livery&mdash;long
great-coats, with small capes, coeval with the sedan, and similar
to the dress of the class in Hogarth&rsquo;s pictures) to edge,
and back, and try at it again, and finally to succeed in carrying
their burden out of Miss Barker&rsquo;s front door.&nbsp; Then we
heard their quick pit-a-pat along the quiet little street as we
put on our calashes and pinned up our gowns; Miss Barker hovering
about us with offers of help, which, if she had not remembered
her former occupation, and wished us to forget it, would have
been much more pressing.</p>
<h2><a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>CHAPTER VIII&mdash;&ldquo;YOUR LADYSHIP&rdquo;</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Early</span> the next
morning&mdash;directly after twelve&mdash;Miss Pole made her
appearance at Miss Matty&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Some very trifling piece
of business was alleged as a reason for the call; but there was
evidently something behind.&nbsp; At last out it came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way, you&rsquo;ll think I&rsquo;m strangely
ignorant; but, do you really know, I am puzzled how we ought to
address Lady Glenmire.&nbsp; Do you say, &lsquo;Your
Ladyship,&rsquo; where you would say &lsquo;you&rsquo; to a
common person?&nbsp; I have been puzzling all morning; and are we
to say &lsquo;My Lady,&rsquo; instead of
&lsquo;Ma&rsquo;am?&rsquo;&nbsp; Now you knew Lady
Arley&mdash;will you kindly tell me the most correct way of
speaking to the peerage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor Miss Matty! she took off her spectacles and she put them
on again&mdash;but how Lady Arley was addressed, she could not
remember.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is so long ago,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dear!
dear! how stupid I am!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think I ever saw her
more than twice.&nbsp; I know we used to call Sir Peter,
&lsquo;Sir Peter&rsquo;&mdash;but he came much oftener to see us
than Lady Arley did.&nbsp; Deborah would have known in a <a
name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>minute.&nbsp; &lsquo;My lady&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;your
ladyship.&rsquo;&nbsp; It sounds very strange, and as if it was
not natural.&nbsp; I never thought of it before; but, now you
have named it, I am all in a puzzle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was very certain Miss Pole would obtain no wise decision
from Miss Matty, who got more bewildered every moment, and more
perplexed as to etiquettes of address.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I really think,&rdquo; said Miss Pole, &ldquo;I
had better just go and tell Mrs Forrester about our little
difficulty.&nbsp; One sometimes grows nervous; and yet one would
not have Lady Glenmire think we were quite ignorant of the
etiquettes of high life in Cranford.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And will you just step in here, dear Miss Pole, as you
come back, please, and tell me what you decide upon?&nbsp;
Whatever you and Mrs Forrester fix upon, will be quite right,
I&rsquo;m sure.&nbsp; &lsquo;Lady Arley,&rsquo; &lsquo;Sir
Peter,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Miss Matty to herself, trying to recall
the old forms of words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is Lady Glenmire?&rdquo; asked I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s the widow of Mr
Jamieson&mdash;that&rsquo;s Mrs Jamieson&rsquo;s late husband,
you know&mdash;widow of his eldest brother.&nbsp; Mrs Jamieson
was a Miss Walker, daughter of Governor Walker.&nbsp; &lsquo;Your
ladyship.&rsquo;&nbsp; My dear, if they fix on that way of
speaking, you must just let me practice a little on you first,
for I shall feel so foolish and hot saying it the first time to
Lady Glenmire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was really a relief to Miss Matty when Mrs Jamieson came on
a very unpolite errand.&nbsp; I notice that apathetic people have
more quiet impertinence than others; and Mrs Jamieson came now to
insinuate <a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
112</span>pretty plainly that she did not particularly wish that
the Cranford ladies should call upon her sister-in-law.&nbsp; I
can hardly say how she made this clear; for I grew very indignant
and warm, while with slow deliberation she was explaining her
wishes to Miss Matty, who, a true lady herself, could hardly
understand the feeling which made Mrs Jamieson wish to appear to
her noble sister-in-law as if she only visited
&ldquo;county&rdquo; families.&nbsp; Miss Matty remained puzzled
and perplexed long after I had found out the object of Mrs
Jamieson&rsquo;s visit.</p>
<p>When she did understand the drift of the honourable
lady&rsquo;s call, it was pretty to see with what quiet dignity
she received the intimation thus uncourteously given.&nbsp; She
was not in the least hurt&mdash;she was of too gentle a spirit
for that; nor was she exactly conscious of disapproving of Mrs
Jamieson&rsquo;s conduct; but there was something of this feeling
in her mind, I am sure, which made her pass from the subject to
others in a less flurried and more composed manner than
usual.&nbsp; Mrs Jamieson was, indeed, the more flurried of the
two, and I could see she was glad to take her leave.</p>
<p>A little while afterwards Miss Pole returned, red and
indignant.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well! to be sure!&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve had
Mrs Jamieson here, I find from Martha; and we are not to call on
Lady Glenmire.&nbsp; Yes!&nbsp; I met Mrs Jamieson, half-way
between here and Mrs Forrester&rsquo;s, and she told me; she took
me so by surprise, I had nothing to say.&nbsp; I wish I had
thought of something very sharp and sarcastic; I dare say I shall
to-night.&nbsp; And Lady Glenmire is but the widow of a Scotch
baron after all!&nbsp; I went on to look at <a
name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>Mrs
Forrester&rsquo;s Peerage, to see who this lady was, that is to
be kept under a glass case: widow of a Scotch peer&mdash;never
sat in the House of Lords&mdash;and as poor as Job, I dare say;
and she&mdash;fifth daughter of some Mr Campbell or other.&nbsp;
You are the daughter of a rector, at any rate, and related to the
Arleys; and Sir Peter might have been Viscount Arley, every one
says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Matty tried to soothe Miss Pole, but in vain.&nbsp; That
lady, usually so kind and good-humoured, was now in a full flow
of anger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I went and ordered a cap this morning, to be quite
ready,&rdquo; said she at last, letting out the secret which gave
sting to Mrs Jamieson&rsquo;s intimation.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mrs
Jamieson shall see if it is so easy to get me to make fourth at a
pool when she has none of her fine Scotch relations with
her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In coming out of church, the first Sunday on which Lady
Glenmire appeared in Cranford, we sedulously talked together, and
turned our backs on Mrs Jamieson and her guest.&nbsp; If we might
not call on her, we would not even look at her, though we were
dying with curiosity to know what she was like.&nbsp; We had the
comfort of questioning Martha in the afternoon.&nbsp; Martha did
not belong to a sphere of society whose observation could be an
implied compliment to Lady Glenmire, and Martha had made good use
of her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, ma&rsquo;am! is it the little lady with Mrs
Jamieson, you mean?&nbsp; I thought you would like more to know
how young Mrs Smith was dressed; her being a bride.&rdquo;&nbsp;
(Mrs Smith was the butcher&rsquo;s wife).</p>
<p>Miss Pole said, &ldquo;Good gracious me! as if we <a
name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>cared about
a Mrs Smith;&rdquo; but was silent as Martha resumed her
speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The little lady in Mrs Jamieson&rsquo;s pew had on,
ma&rsquo;am, rather an old black silk, and a shepherd&rsquo;s
plaid cloak, ma&rsquo;am, and very bright black eyes she had,
ma&rsquo;am, and a pleasant, sharp face; not over young,
ma&rsquo;am, but yet, I should guess, younger than Mrs Jamieson
herself.&nbsp; She looked up and down the church, like a bird,
and nipped up her petticoats, when she came out, as quick and
sharp as ever I see.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell you what, ma&rsquo;am,
she&rsquo;s more like Mrs Deacon, at the &lsquo;Coach and
Horses,&rsquo; nor any one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, Martha!&rdquo; said Miss Matty,
&ldquo;that&rsquo;s not respectful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it, ma&rsquo;am?&nbsp; I beg pardon,
I&rsquo;m sure; but Jem Hearn said so as well.&nbsp; He said, she
was just such a sharp, stirring sort of a body&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; said Miss Pole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lady&mdash;as Mrs Deacon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another Sunday passed away, and we still averted our eyes from
Mrs Jamieson and her guest, and made remarks to ourselves that we
thought were very severe&mdash;almost too much so.&nbsp; Miss
Matty was evidently uneasy at our sarcastic manner of
speaking.</p>
<p>Perhaps by this time Lady Glenmire had found out that Mrs
Jamieson&rsquo;s was not the gayest, liveliest house in the
world; perhaps Mrs Jamieson had found out that most of the county
families were in London, and that those who remained in the
country were not so alive as they might have been to the
circumstance of Lady Glenmire being in their neighbourhood.&nbsp;
Great events spring out of small causes; so I will not pretend to
say what induced Mrs Jamieson to <a name="page115"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 115</span>alter her determination of excluding
the Cranford ladies, and send notes of invitation all round for a
small party on the following Tuesday.&nbsp; Mr Mulliner himself
brought them round.&nbsp; He <i>would</i> always ignore the fact
of there being a back-door to any house, and gave a louder
rat-tat than his mistress, Mrs Jamieson.&nbsp; He had three
little notes, which he carried in a large basket, in order to
impress his mistress with an idea of their great weight, though
they might easily have gone into his waistcoat pocket.</p>
<p>Miss Matty and I quietly decided that we would have a previous
engagement at home: it was the evening on which Miss Matty
usually made candle-lighters of all the notes and letters of the
week; for on Mondays her accounts were always made
straight&mdash;not a penny owing from the week before; so, by a
natural arrangement, making candle-lighters fell upon a Tuesday
evening, and gave us a legitimate excuse for declining Mrs
Jamieson&rsquo;s invitation.&nbsp; But before our answer was
written, in came Miss Pole, with an open note in her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So!&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; I see you
have got your note, too.&nbsp; Better late than never.&nbsp; I
could have told my Lady Glenmire she would be glad enough of our
society before a fortnight was over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Miss Matty, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re asked
for Tuesday evening.&nbsp; And perhaps you would just kindly
bring your work across and drink tea with us that night.&nbsp; It
is my usual regular time for looking over the last week&rsquo;s
bills, and notes, and letters, and making candle-lighters of
them; but that does not seem quite reason enough for saying I
have a previous engagement at home, though I meant to make it
do.&nbsp; <a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
116</span>Now, if you would come, my conscience would be quite at
ease, and luckily the note is not written yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I saw Miss Pole&rsquo;s countenance change while Miss Matty
was speaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you mean to go then?&rdquo; asked she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; said, Miss Matty quietly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t either, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied Miss Pole.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes, I think I do,&rdquo; said she, rather briskly; and on
seeing Miss Matty look surprised, she added, &ldquo;You see, one
would not like Mrs Jamieson to think that anything she could do,
or say, was of consequence enough to give offence; it would be a
kind of letting down of ourselves, that I, for one, should not
like.&nbsp; It would be too flattering to Mrs Jamieson if we
allowed her to suppose that what she had said affected us a week,
nay ten days afterwards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&nbsp; I suppose it is wrong to be hurt and
annoyed so long about anything; and, perhaps, after all, she did
not mean to vex us.&nbsp; But I must say, I could not have
brought myself to say the things Mrs Jamieson did about our not
calling.&nbsp; I really don&rsquo;t think I shall go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come!&nbsp; Miss Matty, you must go; you know our
friend Mrs Jamieson is much more phlegmatic than most people, and
does not enter into the little delicacies of feeling which you
possess in so remarkable a degree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you possessed them, too, that day Mrs
Jamieson called to tell us not to go,&rdquo; said Miss Matty
innocently.</p>
<p>But Miss Pole, in addition to her delicacies of feeling,
possessed a very smart cap, which she was <a
name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>anxious to
show to an admiring world; and so she seemed to forget all her
angry words uttered not a fortnight before, and to be ready to
act on what she called the great Christian principle of
&ldquo;Forgive and forget&rdquo;; and she lectured dear Miss
Matty so long on this head that she absolutely ended by assuring
her it was her duty, as a deceased rector&rsquo;s daughter, to
buy a new cap and go to the party at Mrs Jamieson&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
So &ldquo;we were most happy to accept,&rdquo; instead of
&ldquo;regretting that we were obliged to decline.&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>The expenditure on dress in Cranford was principally in that
one article referred to.&nbsp; If the heads were buried in smart
new caps, the ladies were like ostriches, and cared not what
became of their bodies.&nbsp; Old gowns, white and venerable
collars, any number of brooches, up and down and everywhere (some
with dogs&rsquo; eyes painted in them; some that were like small
picture-frames with mausoleums and weeping-willows neatly
executed in hair inside; some, again, with miniatures of ladies
and gentlemen sweetly smiling out of a nest of stiff muslin), old
brooches for a permanent ornament, and new caps to suit the
fashion of the day&mdash;the ladies of Cranford always dressed
with chaste elegance and propriety, as Miss Barker once prettily
expressed it.</p>
<p>And with three new caps, and a greater array of brooches than
had ever been seen together at one time since Cranford was a
town, did Mrs Forrester, and Miss Matty, and Miss Pole appear on
that memorable Tuesday evening.&nbsp; I counted seven brooches
myself on Miss Pole&rsquo;s dress.&nbsp; Two were fixed
negligently in her cap (one was a butterfly <a
name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>made of
Scotch pebbles, which a vivid imagination might believe to be the
real insect); one fastened her net neckerchief; one her collar;
one ornamented the front of her gown, midway between her throat
and waist; and another adorned the point of her stomacher.&nbsp;
Where the seventh was I have forgotten, but it was somewhere
about her, I am sure.</p>
<p>But I am getting on too fast, in describing the dresses of the
company.&nbsp; I should first relate the gathering on the way to
Mrs Jamieson&rsquo;s.&nbsp; That lady lived in a large house just
outside the town.&nbsp; A road which had known what it was to be
a street ran right before the house, which opened out upon it
without any intervening garden or court.&nbsp; Whatever the sun
was about, he never shone on the front of that house.&nbsp; To be
sure, the living-rooms were at the back, looking on to a pleasant
garden; the front windows only belonged to kitchens and
housekeepers&rsquo; rooms, and pantries, and in one of them Mr
Mulliner was reported to sit.&nbsp; Indeed, looking askance, we
often saw the back of a head covered with hair powder, which also
extended itself over his coat-collar down to his very waist; and
this imposing back was always engaged in reading the <i>St
James&rsquo;s Chronicle</i>, opened wide, which, in some degree,
accounted for the length of time the said newspaper was in
reaching us&mdash;equal subscribers with Mrs Jamieson, though, in
right of her honourableness, she always had the reading of it
first.&nbsp; This very Tuesday, the delay in forwarding the last
number had been particularly aggravating; just when both Miss
Pole and Miss Matty, the former more especially, had been wanting
to see it, in order to coach up the Court news ready <a
name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>for the
evening&rsquo;s interview with aristocracy.&nbsp; Miss Pole told
us she had absolutely taken time by the forelock, and been
dressed by five o&rsquo;clock, in order to be ready if the <i>St
James&rsquo;s Chronicle</i> should come in at the last
moment&mdash;the very <i>St James&rsquo;s Chronicle</i> which the
powdered head was tranquilly and composedly reading as we passed
the accustomed window this evening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The impudence of the man!&rdquo; said Miss Pole, in a
low indignant whisper.&nbsp; &ldquo;I should like to ask him
whether his mistress pays her quarter-share for his exclusive
use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We looked at her in admiration of the courage of her thought;
for Mr Mulliner was an object of great awe to all of us.&nbsp; He
seemed never to have forgotten his condescension in coming to
live at Cranford.&nbsp; Miss Jenkyns, at times, had stood forth
as the undaunted champion of her sex, and spoken to him on terms
of equality; but even Miss Jenkyns could get no higher.&nbsp; In
his pleasantest and most gracious moods he looked like a sulky
cockatoo.&nbsp; He did not speak except in gruff
monosyllables.&nbsp; He would wait in the hall when we begged him
not to wait, and then look deeply offended because we had kept
him there, while, with trembling, hasty hands we prepared
ourselves for appearing in company.</p>
<p>Miss Pole ventured on a small joke as we went upstairs,
intended, though addressed to us, to afford Mr Mulliner some
slight amusement.&nbsp; We all smiled, in order to seem as if we
felt at our ease, and timidly looked for Mr Mulliner&rsquo;s
sympathy.&nbsp; Not a muscle of that wooden face had relaxed; and
we were grave in an instant.</p>
<p><a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>Mrs
Jamieson&rsquo;s drawing-room was cheerful; the evening sun came
streaming into it, and the large square window was clustered
round with flowers.&nbsp; The furniture was white and gold; not
the later style, Louis Quatorze, I think they call it, all shells
and twirls; no, Mrs Jamieson&rsquo;s chairs and tables had not a
curve or bend about them.&nbsp; The chair and table legs
diminished as they neared the ground, and were straight and
square in all their corners.&nbsp; The chairs were all a-row
against the walls, with the exception of four or five which stood
in a circle round the fire.&nbsp; They were railed with white
bars across the back and knobbed with gold; neither the railings
nor the knobs invited to ease.&nbsp; There was a japanned table
devoted to literature, on which lay a Bible, a Peerage, and a
Prayer-Book.&nbsp; There was another square Pembroke table
dedicated to the Fine Arts, on which were a kaleidoscope,
conversation-cards, puzzle-cards (tied together to an
interminable length with faded pink satin ribbon), and a box
painted in fond imitation of the drawings which decorate
tea-chests.&nbsp; Carlo lay on the worsted-worked rug, and
ungraciously barked at us as we entered.&nbsp; Mrs Jamieson stood
up, giving us each a torpid smile of welcome, and looking
helplessly beyond us at Mr Mulliner, as if she hoped he would
place us in chairs, for, if he did not, she never could.&nbsp; I
suppose he thought we could find our way to the circle round the
fire, which reminded me of Stonehenge, I don&rsquo;t know
why.&nbsp; Lady Glenmire came to the rescue of our hostess, and,
somehow or other, we found ourselves for the first time placed
agreeably, and not formally, in Mrs Jamieson&rsquo;s house.&nbsp;
Lady Glenmire, now we had time to look at her, <a
name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>proved to
be a bright little woman of middle age, who had been very pretty
in the days of her youth, and who was even yet very
pleasant-looking.&nbsp; I saw Miss Pole appraising her dress in
the first five minutes, and I take her word when she said the
next day&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear! ten pounds would have purchased every stitch
she had on&mdash;lace and all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was pleasant to suspect that a peeress could be poor, and
partly reconciled us to the fact that her husband had never sat
in the House of Lords; which, when we first heard of it, seemed a
kind of swindling us out of our prospects on false pretences; a
sort of &ldquo;A Lord and No Lord&rdquo; business.</p>
<p>We were all very silent at first.&nbsp; We were thinking what
we could talk about, that should be high enough to interest My
Lady.&nbsp; There had been a rise in the price of sugar, which,
as preserving-time was near, was a piece of intelligence to all
our house-keeping hearts, and would have been the natural topic
if Lady Glenmire had not been by.&nbsp; But we were not sure if
the peerage ate preserves&mdash;much less knew how they were
made.&nbsp; At last, Miss Pole, who had always a great deal of
courage and <i>savoir faire</i>, spoke to Lady Glenmire, who on
her part had seemed just as much puzzled to know how to break the
silence as we were.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has your ladyship been to Court lately?&rdquo; asked
she; and then gave a little glance round at us, half timid and
half triumphant, as much as to say, &ldquo;See how judiciously I
have chosen a subject befitting the rank of the
stranger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never was there in my life,&rdquo; said Lady <a
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>Glenmire,
with a broad Scotch accent, but in a very sweet voice.&nbsp; And
then, as if she had been too abrupt, she added: &ldquo;We very
seldom went to London&mdash;only twice, in fact, during all my
married life; and before I was married my father had far too
large a family&rdquo; (fifth daughter of Mr Campbell was in all
our minds, I am sure) &ldquo;to take us often from our home, even
to Edinburgh.&nbsp; Ye&rsquo;ll have been in Edinburgh,
maybe?&rdquo; said she, suddenly brightening up with the hope of
a common interest.&nbsp; We had none of us been there; but Miss
Pole had an uncle who once had passed a night there, which was
very pleasant.</p>
<p>Mrs Jamieson, meanwhile, was absorbed in wonder why Mr
Mulliner did not bring the tea; and at length the wonder oozed
out of her mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had better ring the bell, my dear, had not I?&rdquo;
said Lady Glenmire briskly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;I think not&mdash;Mulliner does not like to be
hurried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We should have liked our tea, for we dined at an earlier hour
than Mrs Jamieson.&nbsp; I suspect Mr Mulliner had to finish the
<i>St James&rsquo;s Chronicle</i> before he chose to trouble
himself about tea.&nbsp; His mistress fidgeted and fidgeted, and
kept saying, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think why Mulliner does not
bring tea.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t think what he can be
about.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Lady Glenmire at last grew quite
impatient, but it was a pretty kind of impatience after all; and
she rang the bell rather sharply, on receiving a half-permission
from her sister-in-law to do so.&nbsp; Mr Mulliner appeared in
dignified surprise.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Mrs Jamieson,
&ldquo;Lady Glenmire rang the bell; I believe it was for
tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>In a
few minutes tea was brought.&nbsp; Very delicate was the china,
very old the plate, very thin the bread and butter, and very
small the lumps of sugar.&nbsp; Sugar was evidently Mrs
Jamieson&rsquo;s favourite economy.&nbsp; I question if the
little filigree sugar-tongs, made something like scissors, could
have opened themselves wide enough to take up an honest, vulgar
good-sized piece; and when I tried to seize two little minnikin
pieces at once, so as not to be detected in too many returns to
the sugar-basin, they absolutely dropped one, with a little sharp
clatter, quite in a malicious and unnatural manner.&nbsp; But
before this happened we had had a slight disappointment.&nbsp; In
the little silver jug was cream, in the larger one was
milk.&nbsp; As soon as Mr Mulliner came in, Carlo began to beg,
which was a thing our manners forebade us to do, though I am sure
we were just as hungry; and Mrs Jamieson said she was certain we
would excuse her if she gave her poor dumb Carlo his tea
first.&nbsp; She accordingly mixed a saucerful for him, and put
it down for him to lap; and then she told us how intelligent and
sensible the dear little fellow was; he knew cream quite well,
and constantly refused tea with only milk in it: so the milk was
left for us; but we silently thought we were quite as intelligent
and sensible as Carlo, and felt as if insult were added to injury
when we were called upon to admire the gratitude evinced by his
wagging his tail for the cream which should have been ours.</p>
<p>After tea we thawed down into common-life subjects.&nbsp; We
were thankful to Lady Glenmire for having proposed some more
bread and butter, and this mutual want made us better acquainted
with her <a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
124</span>than we should ever have been with talking about the
Court, though Miss Pole did say she had hoped to know how the
dear Queen was from some one who had seen her.</p>
<p>The friendship begun over bread and butter extended on to
cards.&nbsp; Lady Glenmire played Preference to admiration, and
was a complete authority as to Ombre and Quadrille.&nbsp; Even
Miss Pole quite forgot to say &ldquo;my lady,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;your ladyship,&rdquo; and said &ldquo;Basto!
ma&rsquo;am&rdquo;; &ldquo;you have Spadille, I believe,&rdquo;
just as quietly as if we had never held the great Cranford
Parliament on the subject of the proper mode of addressing a
peeress.</p>
<p>As a proof of how thoroughly we had forgotten that we were in
the presence of one who might have sat down to tea with a
coronet, instead of a cap, on her head, Mrs Forrester related a
curious little fact to Lady Glenmire&mdash;an anecdote known to
the circle of her intimate friends, but of which even Mrs
Jamieson was not aware.&nbsp; It related to some fine old lace,
the sole relic of better days, which Lady Glenmire was admiring
on Mrs Forrester&rsquo;s collar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said that lady, &ldquo;such lace cannot be
got now for either love or money; made by the nuns abroad, they
tell me.&nbsp; They say that they can&rsquo;t make it now even
there.&nbsp; But perhaps they can, now they&rsquo;ve passed the
Catholic Emancipation Bill.&nbsp; I should not wonder.&nbsp; But,
in the meantime, I treasure up my lace very much.&nbsp; I
daren&rsquo;t even trust the washing of it to my maid&rdquo; (the
little charity school-girl I have named before, but who sounded
well as &ldquo;my maid&rdquo;).&nbsp; &ldquo;I always wash it
myself.&nbsp; And once <a name="page125"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 125</span>it had a narrow escape.&nbsp; Of
course, your ladyship knows that such lace must never be starched
or ironed.&nbsp; Some people wash it in sugar and water, and some
in coffee, to make it the right yellow colour; but I myself have
a very good receipt for washing it in milk, which stiffens it
enough, and gives it a very good creamy colour.&nbsp; Well,
ma&rsquo;am, I had tacked it together (and the beauty of this
fine lace is that, when it is wet, it goes into a very little
space), and put it to soak in milk, when, unfortunately, I left
the room; on my return, I found pussy on the table, looking very
like a thief, but gulping very uncomfortably, as if she was
half-chocked with something she wanted to swallow and could
not.&nbsp; And, would you believe it?&nbsp; At first I pitied
her, and said &lsquo;Poor pussy! poor pussy!&rsquo; till, all at
once, I looked and saw the cup of milk empty&mdash;cleaned
out!&nbsp; &lsquo;You naughty cat!&rsquo; said I, and I believe I
was provoked enough to give her a slap, which did no good, but
only helped the lace down&mdash;just as one slaps a choking child
on the back.&nbsp; I could have cried, I was so vexed; but I
determined I would not give the lace up without a struggle for
it.&nbsp; I hoped the lace might disagree with her, at any rate;
but it would have been too much for Job, if he had seen, as I
did, that cat come in, quite placid and purring, not a quarter of
an hour after, and almost expecting to be stroked.&nbsp;
&lsquo;No, pussy!&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;if you have any
conscience you ought not to expect that!&rsquo;&nbsp; And then a
thought struck me; and I rang the bell for my maid, and sent her
to Mr Hoggins, with my compliments, and would he be kind enough
to lend me one of his top-boots <a name="page126"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 126</span>for an hour?&nbsp; I did not think
there was anything odd in the message; but Jenny said the young
men in the surgery laughed as if they would be ill at my wanting
a top-boot.&nbsp; When it came, Jenny and I put pussy in, with
her forefeet straight down, so that they were fastened, and could
not scratch, and we gave her a teaspoonful of current-jelly in
which (your ladyship must excuse me) I had mixed some tartar
emetic.&nbsp; I shall never forget how anxious I was for the next
half-hour.&nbsp; I took pussy to my own room, and spread a clean
towel on the floor.&nbsp; I could have kissed her when she
returned the lace to sight, very much as it had gone down.&nbsp;
Jenny had boiling water ready, and we soaked it and soaked it,
and spread it on a lavender-bush in the sun before I could touch
it again, even to put it in milk.&nbsp; But now your ladyship
would never guess that it had been in pussy&rsquo;s
inside.&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>We found out, in the course of the evening, that Lady Glenmire
was going to pay Mrs Jamieson a long visit, as she had given up
her apartments in Edinburgh, and had no ties to take her back
there in a hurry.&nbsp; On the whole, we were rather glad to hear
this, for she had made a pleasant impression upon us; and it was
also very comfortable to find, from things which dropped out in
the course of conversation, that, in addition to many other
genteel qualities, she was far removed from the &ldquo;vulgarity
of wealth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you find it very unpleasant walking?&rdquo;
asked Mrs Jamieson, as our respective servants were
announced.&nbsp; It was a pretty regular question from Mrs
Jamieson, who had her own carriage in the <a
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
127</span>coach-house, and always went out in a sedan-chair to
the very shortest distances.&nbsp; The answers were nearly as
much a matter of course.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear, no! it is so pleasant and still at
night!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Such a refreshment after the
excitement of a party!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The stars are so
beautiful!&rdquo;&nbsp; This last was from Miss Matty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you fond of astronomy?&rdquo; Lady Glenmire
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not very,&rdquo; replied Miss Matty, rather confused at
the moment to remember which was astronomy and which was
astrology&mdash;but the answer was true under either
circumstance, for she read, and was slightly alarmed at Francis
Moore&rsquo;s astrological predictions; and, as to astronomy, in
a private and confidential conversation, she had told me she
never could believe that the earth was moving constantly, and
that she would not believe it if she could, it made her feel so
tired and dizzy whenever she thought about it.</p>
<p>In our pattens we picked our way home with extra care that
night, so refined and delicate were our perceptions after
drinking tea with &ldquo;my lady.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
128</span>CHAPTER IX&mdash;SIGNOR BRUNONI</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Soon</span> after the events of which I
gave an account in my last paper, I was summoned home by my
father&rsquo;s illness; and for a time I forgot, in anxiety about
him, to wonder how my dear friends at Cranford were getting on,
or how Lady Glenmire could reconcile herself to the dulness of
the long visit which she was still paying to her sister-in-law,
Mrs Jamieson.&nbsp; When my father grew a little stronger I
accompanied him to the seaside, so that altogether I seemed
banished from Cranford, and was deprived of the opportunity of
hearing any chance intelligence of the dear little town for the
greater part of that year.</p>
<p>Late in November&mdash;when we had returned home again, and my
father was once more in good health&mdash;I received a letter
from Miss Matty; and a very mysterious letter it was.&nbsp; She
began many sentences without ending them, running them one into
another, in much the same confused sort of way in which written
words run together on blotting-paper.&nbsp; All I could make out
was that, if my father was better (which she hoped he was), and
would take warning and wear a great-coat from Michaelmas to
Lady-day, <a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
129</span>if turbans were in fashion, could I tell her?&nbsp;
Such a piece of gaiety was going to happen as had not been seen
or known of since Wombwell&rsquo;s lions came, when one of them
ate a little child&rsquo;s arm; and she was, perhaps, too old to
care about dress, but a new cap she must have; and, having heard
that turbans were worn, and some of the county families likely to
come, she would like to look tidy, if I would bring her a cap
from the milliner I employed; and oh, dear! how careless of her
to forget that she wrote to beg I would come and pay her a visit
next Tuesday; when she hoped to have something to offer me in the
way of amusement, which she would not now more particularly
describe, only sea-green was her favourite colour.&nbsp; So she
ended her letter; but in a P.S. she added, she thought she might
as well tell me what was the peculiar attraction to Cranford just
now; Signor Brunoni was going to exhibit his wonderful magic in
the Cranford Assembly Rooms on Wednesday and Friday evening in
the following week.</p>
<p>I was very glad to accept the invitation from my dear Miss
Matty, independently of the conjuror, and most particularly
anxious to prevent her from disfiguring her small, gentle, mousey
face with a great Saracen&rsquo;s head turban; and accordingly, I
bought her a pretty, neat, middle-aged cap, which, however, was
rather a disappointment to her when, on my arrival, she followed
me into my bedroom, ostensibly to poke the fire, but in reality,
I do believe, to see if the sea-green turban was not inside the
cap-box with which I had travelled.&nbsp; It was in vain that I
twirled the cap round on my hand to exhibit back and side fronts:
her heart had been set upon a turban, and all she <a
name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>could do
was to say, with resignation in her look and voice&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure you did your best, my dear.&nbsp; It is just
like the caps all the ladies in Cranford are wearing, and they
have had theirs for a year, I dare say.&nbsp; I should have liked
something newer, I confess&mdash;something more like the turbans
Miss Betty Barker tells me Queen Adelaide wears; but it is very
pretty, my dear.&nbsp; And I dare say lavender will wear better
than sea-green.&nbsp; Well, after all, what is dress, that we
should care anything about it?&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll tell me if you
want anything, my dear.&nbsp; Here is the bell.&nbsp; I suppose
turbans have not got down to Drumble yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying, the dear old lady gently bemoaned herself out of
the room, leaving me to dress for the evening, when, as she
informed me, she expected Miss Pole and Mrs Forrester, and she
hoped I should not feel myself too much tired to join the
party.&nbsp; Of course I should not; and I made some haste to
unpack and arrange my dress; but, with all my speed, I heard the
arrivals and the buzz of conversation in the next room before I
was ready.&nbsp; Just as I opened the door, I caught the words,
&ldquo;I was foolish to expect anything very genteel out of the
Drumble shops; poor girl! she did her best, I&rsquo;ve no
doubt.&rdquo;&nbsp; But, for all that, I had rather that she
blamed Drumble and me than disfigured herself with a turban.</p>
<p>Miss Pole was always the person, in the trio of Cranford
ladies now assembled, to have had adventures.&nbsp; She was in
the habit of spending the morning in rambling from shop to shop,
not to purchase anything (except an occasional reel of cotton or
a piece <a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
131</span>of tape), but to see the new articles and report upon
them, and to collect all the stray pieces of intelligence in the
town.&nbsp; She had a way, too, of demurely popping hither and
thither into all sorts of places to gratify her curiosity on any
point&mdash;a way which, if she had not looked so very genteel
and prim, might have been considered impertinent.&nbsp; And now,
by the expressive way in which she cleared her throat, and waited
for all minor subjects (such as caps and turbans) to be cleared
off the course, we knew she had something very particular to
relate, when the due pause came&mdash;and I defy any people
possessed of common modesty to keep up a conversation long, where
one among them sits up aloft in silence, looking down upon all
the things they chance to say as trivial and contemptible
compared to what they could disclose, if properly
entreated.&nbsp; Miss Pole began&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I was stepping out of Gordon&rsquo;s shop to-day, I
chanced to go into the &lsquo;George&rsquo; (my Betty has a
second-cousin who is chambermaid there, and I thought Betty would
like to hear how she was), and, not seeing anyone about, I
strolled up the staircase, and found myself in the passage
leading to the Assembly Room (you and I remember the Assembly
Room, I am sure, Miss Matty! and the minuets de la cour!); so I
went on, not thinking of what I was about, when, all at once, I
perceived that I was in the middle of the preparations for
to-morrow night&mdash;the room being divided with great
clothes-maids, over which Crosby&rsquo;s men were tacking red
flannel; very dark and odd it seemed; it quite bewildered me, and
I was going on behind the screens, in my absence of mind, when a
gentleman (quite the <a name="page132"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 132</span>gentleman, I can assure you) stepped
forwards and asked if I had any business he could arrange for
me.&nbsp; He spoke such pretty broken English, I could not help
thinking of Thaddeus of Warsaw, and the Hungarian Brothers, and
Santo Sebastiani; and while I was busy picturing his past life to
myself, he had bowed me out of the room.&nbsp; But wait a
minute!&nbsp; You have not heard half my story yet!&nbsp; I was
going downstairs, when who should I meet but Betty&rsquo;s
second-cousin.&nbsp; So, of course, I stopped to speak to her for
Betty&rsquo;s sake; and she told me that I had really seen the
conjuror&mdash;the gentleman who spoke broken English was Signor
Brunoni himself.&nbsp; Just at this moment he passed us on the
stairs, making such a graceful bow! in reply to which I dropped a
curtsey&mdash;all foreigners have such polite manners, one
catches something of it.&nbsp; But when he had gone downstairs, I
bethought me that I had dropped my glove in the Assembly Room (it
was safe in my muff all the time, but I never found it till
afterwards); so I went back, and, just as I was creeping up the
passage left on one side of the great screen that goes nearly
across the room, who should I see but the very same gentleman
that had met me before, and passed me on the stairs, coming now
forwards from the inner part of the room, to which there is no
entrance&mdash;you remember, Miss Matty&mdash;and just repeating,
in his pretty broken English, the inquiry if I had any business
there&mdash;I don&rsquo;t mean that he put it quite so bluntly,
but he seemed very determined that I should not pass the
screen&mdash;so, of course, I explained about my glove, which,
curiously enough, I found at that very moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>Miss
Pole, then, had seen the conjuror&mdash;the real, live conjuror!
and numerous were the questions we all asked her.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Had he a beard?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Was he young, or
old?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Fair, or dark?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Did
he look&rdquo;&mdash;(unable to shape my question prudently, I
put it in another form)&mdash;&ldquo;How did he
look?&rdquo;&nbsp; In short, Miss Pole was the heroine of the
evening, owing to her morning&rsquo;s encounter.&nbsp; If she was
not the rose (that is to say the conjuror) she had been near
it.</p>
<p>Conjuration, sleight of hand, magic, witchcraft, were the
subjects of the evening.&nbsp; Miss Pole was slightly sceptical,
and inclined to think there might be a scientific solution found
for even the proceedings of the Witch of Endor.&nbsp; Mrs
Forrester believed everything, from ghosts to
death-watches.&nbsp; Miss Matty ranged between the
two&mdash;always convinced by the last speaker.&nbsp; I think she
was naturally more inclined to Mrs Forrester&rsquo;s side, but a
desire of proving herself a worthy sister to Miss Jenkyns kept
her equally balanced&mdash;Miss Jenkyns, who would never allow a
servant to call the little rolls of tallow that formed themselves
round candles &ldquo;winding-sheets,&rdquo; but insisted on their
being spoken of as &ldquo;roley-poleys!&rdquo;&nbsp; A sister of
hers to be superstitious!&nbsp; It would never do.</p>
<p>After tea, I was despatched downstairs into the dining-parlour
for that volume of the old Encyclop&aelig;dia which contained the
nouns beginning with C, in order that Miss Pole might prime
herself with scientific explanations for the tricks of the
following evening.&nbsp; It spoilt the pool at Preference which
Miss Matty and Mrs Forrester had been looking forward to, for
Miss Pole became so much absorbed in her subject, <a
name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>and the
plates by which it was illustrated, that we felt it would be
cruel to disturb her otherwise than by one or two well-timed
yawns, which I threw in now and then, for I was really touched by
the meek way in which the two ladies were bearing their
disappointment.&nbsp; But Miss Pole only read the more zealously,
imparting to us no more information than this&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! I see; I comprehend perfectly.&nbsp; A represents
the ball.&nbsp; Put A between B and D&mdash;no! between C and F,
and turn the second joint of the third finger of your left hand
over the wrist of your right H.&nbsp; Very clear indeed!&nbsp; My
dear Mrs Forrester, conjuring and witchcraft is a mere affair of
the alphabet.&nbsp; Do let me read you this one
passage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Forrester implored Miss Pole to spare her, saying, from a
child upwards, she never could understand being read aloud to;
and I dropped the pack of cards, which I had been shuffling very
audibly, and by this discreet movement I obliged Miss Pole to
perceive that Preference was to have been the order of the
evening, and to propose, rather unwillingly, that the pool should
commence.&nbsp; The pleasant brightness that stole over the other
two ladies&rsquo; faces on this!&nbsp; Miss Matty had one or two
twinges of self-reproach for having interrupted Miss Pole in her
studies: and did not remember her cards well, or give her full
attention to the game, until she had soothed her conscience by
offering to lend the volume of the Encyclop&aelig;dia to Miss
Pole, who accepted it thankfully, and said Betty should take it
home when she came with the lantern.</p>
<p><a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>The
next evening we were all in a little gentle flutter at the idea
of the gaiety before us.&nbsp; Miss Matty went up to dress
betimes, and hurried me until I was ready, when we found we had
an hour-and-a-half to wait before the &ldquo;doors opened at
seven precisely.&rdquo;&nbsp; And we had only twenty yards to
go!&nbsp; However, as Miss Matty said, it would not do to get too
much absorbed in anything, and forget the time; so she thought we
had better sit quietly, without lighting the candles, till five
minutes to seven.&nbsp; So Miss Matty dozed, and I knitted.</p>
<p>At length we set off; and at the door under the carriage-way
at the &ldquo;George,&rdquo; we met Mrs Forrester and Miss Pole:
the latter was discussing the subject of the evening with more
vehemence than ever, and throwing X&rsquo;s and B&rsquo;s at our
heads like hailstones.&nbsp; She had even copied one or two of
the &ldquo;receipts&rdquo;&mdash;as she called them&mdash;for the
different tricks, on backs of letters, ready to explain and to
detect Signor Brunoni&rsquo;s arts.</p>
<p>We went into the cloak-room adjoining the Assembly Room; Miss
Matty gave a sigh or two to her departed youth, and the
remembrance of the last time she had been there, as she adjusted
her pretty new cap before the strange, quaint old mirror in the
cloak-room.&nbsp; The Assembly Room had been added to the inn,
about a hundred years before, by the different county families,
who met together there once a month during the winter to dance
and play at cards.&nbsp; Many a county beauty had first swung
through the minuet that she afterwards danced before Queen
Charlotte in this very room.&nbsp; It was said that one of the
Gunnings had graced the apartment <a name="page136"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 136</span>with her beauty; it was certain that
a rich and beautiful widow, Lady Williams, had here been smitten
with the noble figure of a young artist, who was staying with
some family in the neighbourhood for professional purposes, and
accompanied his patrons to the Cranford Assembly.&nbsp; And a
pretty bargain poor Lady Williams had of her handsome husband, if
all tales were true.&nbsp; Now, no beauty blushed and dimpled
along the sides of the Cranford Assembly Room; no handsome artist
won hearts by his bow, <i>chapeau bras</i> in hand; the old room
was dingy; the salmon-coloured paint had faded into a drab; great
pieces of plaster had chipped off from the fine wreaths and
festoons on its walls; but still a mouldy odour of aristocracy
lingered about the place, and a dusty recollection of the days
that were gone made Miss Matty and Mrs Forrester bridle up as
they entered, and walk mincingly up the room, as if there were a
number of genteel observers, instead of two little boys with a
stick of toffee between them with which to beguile the time.</p>
<p>We stopped short at the second front row; I could hardly
understand why, until I heard Miss Pole ask a stray waiter if any
of the county families were expected; and when he shook his head,
and believed not, Mrs Forrester and Miss Matty moved forwards,
and our party represented a conversational square.&nbsp; The
front row was soon augmented and enriched by Lady Glenmire and
Mrs Jamieson.&nbsp; We six occupied the two front rows, and our
aristocratic seclusion was respected by the groups of
shop-keepers who strayed in from time to time and huddled
together on the back benches.&nbsp; At least I conjectured <a
name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>so, from
the noise they made, and the sonorous bumps they gave in sitting
down; but when, in weariness of the obstinate green curtain that
would not draw up, but would stare at me with two odd eyes, seen
through holes, as in the old tapestry story, I would fain have
looked round at the merry chattering people behind me, Miss Pole
clutched my arm, and begged me not to turn, for &ldquo;it was not
the thing.&rdquo;&nbsp; What &ldquo;the thing&rdquo; was, I never
could find out, but it must have been something eminently dull
and tiresome.&nbsp; However, we all sat eyes right, square front,
gazing at the tantalising curtain, and hardly speaking
intelligibly, we were so afraid of being caught in the vulgarity
of making any noise in a place of public amusement.&nbsp; Mrs
Jamieson was the most fortunate, for she fell asleep.</p>
<p>At length the eyes disappeared&mdash;the curtain
quivered&mdash;one side went up before the other, which stuck
fast; it was dropped again, and, with a fresh effort, and a
vigorous pull from some unseen hand, it flew up, revealing to our
sight a magnificent gentleman in the Turkish costume, seated
before a little table, gazing at us (I should have said with the
same eyes that I had last seen through the hole in the curtain)
with calm and condescending dignity, &ldquo;like a being of
another sphere,&rdquo; as I heard a sentimental voice ejaculate
behind me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not Signor Brunoni!&rdquo; said Miss Pole
decidedly; and so audibly that I am sure he heard, for he glanced
down over his flowing beard at our party with an air of mute
reproach.&nbsp; &ldquo;Signor Brunoni had no beard&mdash;but
perhaps he&rsquo;ll come soon.&rdquo;&nbsp; So she lulled herself
into patience.&nbsp; Meanwhile, Miss <a name="page138"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 138</span>Matty had reconnoitred through her
eye-glass, wiped it, and looked again.&nbsp; Then she turned
round, and said to me, in a kind, mild, sorrowful tone&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, my dear, turbans <i>are</i> worn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But we had no time for more conversation.&nbsp; The Grand
Turk, as Miss Pole chose to call him, arose and announced himself
as Signor Brunoni.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe him!&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Pole,
in a defiant manner.&nbsp; He looked at her again, with the same
dignified upbraiding in his countenance.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she repeated more positively than ever.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Signor Brunoni had not got that muffy sort of thing about
his chin, but looked like a close-shaved Christian
gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Pole&rsquo;s energetic speeches had the good effect of
wakening up Mrs Jamieson, who opened her eyes wide, in sign of
the deepest attention&mdash;a proceeding which silenced Miss Pole
and encouraged the Grand Turk to proceed, which he did in very
broken English&mdash;so broken that there was no cohesion between
the parts of his sentences; a fact which he himself perceived at
last, and so left off speaking and proceeded to action.</p>
<p>Now we <i>were</i> astonished.&nbsp; How he did his tricks I
could not imagine; no, not even when Miss Pole pulled out her
pieces of paper and began reading aloud&mdash;or at least in a
very audible whisper&mdash;the separate &ldquo;receipts&rdquo;
for the most common of his tricks.&nbsp; If ever I saw a man
frown and look enraged, I saw the Grand Turk frown at Miss Pole;
but, as she said, what could be expected but unchristian looks
from a Mussulman?&nbsp; If Miss Pole were sceptical, and more
engrossed with her receipts <a name="page139"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 139</span>and diagrams than with his tricks,
Miss Matty and Mrs Forrester were mystified and perplexed to the
highest degree.&nbsp; Mrs Jamieson kept taking her spectacles off
and wiping them, as if she thought it was something defective in
them which made the legerdemain; and Lady Glenmire, who had seen
many curious sights in Edinburgh, was very much struck with the
tricks, and would not at all agree with Miss Pole, who declared
that anybody could do them with a little practice, and that she
would, herself, undertake to do all he did, with two hours given
to study the Encyclop&aelig;dia and make her third finger
flexible.</p>
<p>At last Miss Matty and Mrs Forrester became perfectly
awestricken.&nbsp; They whispered together.&nbsp; I sat just
behind them, so I could not help hearing what they were
saying.&nbsp; Miss Matty asked Mrs Forrester &ldquo;if she
thought it was quite right to have come to see such things?&nbsp;
She could not help fearing they were lending encouragement to
something that was not quite&rdquo;&mdash;&nbsp; A little shake
of the head filled up the blank.&nbsp; Mrs Forrester replied,
that the same thought had crossed her mind; she too was feeling
very uncomfortable, it was so very strange.&nbsp; She was quite
certain that it was her pocket-handkerchief which was in that
loaf just now; and it had been in her own hand not five minutes
before.&nbsp; She wondered who had furnished the bread?&nbsp; She
was sure it could not be Dakin, because he was the
churchwarden.&nbsp; Suddenly Miss Matty half-turned towards
me&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you look, my dear&mdash;you are a stranger in the
town, and it won&rsquo;t give rise to unpleasant <a
name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
140</span>reports&mdash;will you just look round and see if the
rector is here?&nbsp; If he is, I think we may conclude that this
wonderful man is sanctioned by the Church, and that will be a
great relief to my mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked, and I saw the tall, thin, dry, dusty rector, sitting
surrounded by National School boys, guarded by troops of his own
sex from any approach of the many Cranford spinsters.&nbsp; His
kind face was all agape with broad smiles, and the boys around
him were in chinks of laughing.&nbsp; I told Miss Matty that the
Church was smiling approval, which set her mind at ease.</p>

</a></p>
<p>I have never named Mr Hayter, the rector, because I, as a
well-to-do and happy young woman, never came in contact with
him.&nbsp; He was an old bachelor, but as afraid of matrimonial
reports getting abroad about him as any girl of eighteen: and he
would rush into a shop or dive down an entry, sooner than
encounter any of the Cranford ladies in the street; and, as for
the Preference parties, I did not wonder at his not accepting
invitations to them.&nbsp; To tell the truth, I always suspected
Miss Pole of having given very vigorous chase to Mr Hayter when
he first came to Cranford; and not the less, because now she
appeared to share so vividly in his dread lest her name should
ever be coupled with his.&nbsp; He found all his interests among
the poor and helpless; he had treated the National School boys
this very night to the performance; and virtue was for once its
own reward, for they guarded him right and left, and clung round
him as if he had been the queen-bee and they the swarm.&nbsp; He
felt so safe in their <a name="page141"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 141</span>environment that he could even
afford to give our party a bow as we filed out.&nbsp; Miss Pole
ignored his presence, and pretended to be absorbed in convincing
us that we had been cheated, and had not seen Signor Brunoni
after all.</p>
<h2><a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
142</span>CHAPTER X&mdash;THE PANIC</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">think</span> a series of circumstances
dated from Signor Brunoni&rsquo;s visit to Cranford, which seemed
at the time connected in our minds with him, though I don&rsquo;t
know that he had anything really to do with them.&nbsp; All at
once all sorts of uncomfortable rumours got afloat in the
town.&nbsp; There were one or two robberies&mdash;real
<i>bon&acirc; fide</i> robberies; men had up before the
magistrates and committed for trial&mdash;and that seemed to make
us all afraid of being robbed; and for a long time, at Miss
Matty&rsquo;s, I know, we used to make a regular expedition all
round the kitchens and cellars every night, Miss Matty leading
the way, armed with the poker, I following with the hearth-brush,
and Martha carrying the shovel and fire-irons with which to sound
the alarm; and by the accidental hitting together of them she
often frightened us so much that we bolted ourselves up, all
three together, in the back-kitchen, or store-room, or wherever
we happened to be, till, when our affright was over, we
recollected ourselves and set out afresh with double
valiance.&nbsp; By day we heard strange stories from the
shopkeepers and <a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
143</span>cottagers, of carts that went about in the dead of
night, drawn by horses shod with felt, and guarded by men in dark
clothes, going round the town, no doubt in search of some
unwatched house or some unfastened door.</p>
<p>Miss Pole, who affected great bravery herself, was the
principal person to collect and arrange these reports so as to
make them assume their most fearful aspect.&nbsp; But we
discovered that she had begged one of Mr Hoggins&rsquo;s worn-out
hats to hang up in her lobby, and we (at least I) had doubts as
to whether she really would enjoy the little adventure of having
her house broken into, as she protested she should.&nbsp; Miss
Matty made no secret of being an arrant coward, but she went
regularly through her housekeeper&rsquo;s duty of
inspection&mdash;only the hour for this became earlier and
earlier, till at last we went the rounds at half-past six, and
Miss Matty adjourned to bed soon after seven, &ldquo;in order to
get the night over the sooner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cranford had so long piqued itself on being an honest and
moral town that it had grown to fancy itself too genteel and
well-bred to be otherwise, and felt the stain upon its character
at this time doubly.&nbsp; But we comforted ourselves with the
assurance which we gave to each other that the robberies could
never have been committed by any Cranford person; it must have
been a stranger or strangers who brought this disgrace upon the
town, and occasioned as many precautions as if we were living
among the Red Indians or the French.</p>
<p>This last comparison of our nightly state of defence and
fortification was made by Mrs Forrester, <a
name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>whose
father had served under General Burgoyne in the American war, and
whose husband had fought the French in Spain.&nbsp; She indeed
inclined to the idea that, in some way, the French were connected
with the small thefts, which were ascertained facts, and the
burglaries and highway robberies, which were rumours.&nbsp; She
had been deeply impressed with the idea of French spies at some
time in her life; and the notion could never be fairly
eradicated, but sprang up again from time to time.&nbsp; And now
her theory was this:&mdash;The Cranford people respected
themselves too much, and were too grateful to the aristocracy who
were so kind as to live near the town, ever to disgrace their
bringing up by being dishonest or immoral; therefore, we must
believe that the robbers were strangers&mdash;if strangers, why
not foreigners?&mdash;if foreigners, who so likely as the
French?&nbsp; Signor Brunoni spoke broken English like a
Frenchman; and, though he wore a turban like a Turk, Mrs
Forrester had seen a print of Madame de Sta&euml;l with a turban
on, and another of Mr Denon in just such a dress as that in which
the conjuror had made his appearance, showing clearly that the
French, as well as the Turks, wore turbans.&nbsp; There could be
no doubt Signor Brunoni was a Frenchman&mdash;a French spy come
to discover the weak and undefended places of England, and
doubtless he had his accomplices.&nbsp; For her part, she, Mrs
Forrester, had always had her own opinion of Miss Pole&rsquo;s
adventure at the &ldquo;George Inn&rdquo;&mdash;seeing two men
where only one was believed to be.&nbsp; French people had ways
and means which, she was thankful to say, the English knew
nothing about; and she had never felt quite easy in her mind <a
name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>about going
to see that conjuror&mdash;it was rather too much like a
forbidden thing, though the rector was there.&nbsp; In short, Mrs
Forrester grew more excited than we had ever known her before,
and, being an officer&rsquo;s daughter and widow, we looked up to
her opinion, of course.</p>
<p>Really I do not know how much was true or false in the reports
which flew about like wildfire just at this time; but it seemed
to me then that there was every reason to believe that at Mardon
(a small town about eight miles from Cranford) houses and shops
were entered by holes made in the walls, the bricks being
silently carried away in the dead of the night, and all done so
quietly that no sound was heard either in or out of the
house.&nbsp; Miss Matty gave it up in despair when she heard of
this.&nbsp; &ldquo;What was the use,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;of
locks and bolts, and bells to the windows, and going round the
house every night?&nbsp; That last trick was fit for a
conjuror.&nbsp; Now she did believe that Signor Brunoni was at
the bottom of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One afternoon, about five o&rsquo;clock, we were startled by a
hasty knock at the door.&nbsp; Miss Matty bade me run and tell
Martha on no account to open the door till she (Miss Matty) had
reconnoitred through the window; and she armed herself with a
footstool to drop down on the head of the visitor, in case he
should show a face covered with black crape, as he looked up in
answer to her inquiry of who was there.&nbsp; But it was nobody
but Miss Pole and Betty.&nbsp; The former came upstairs, carrying
a little hand-basket, and she was evidently in a state of great
agitation.</p>
<p><a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
146</span>&ldquo;Take care of that!&rdquo; said she to me, as I
offered to relieve her of her basket.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my
plate.&nbsp; I am sure there is a plan to rob my house
to-night.&nbsp; I am come to throw myself on your hospitality,
Miss Matty.&nbsp; Betty is going to sleep with her cousin at the
&lsquo;George.&rsquo;&nbsp; I can sit up here all night if you
will allow me; but my house is so far from any neighbours, and I
don&rsquo;t believe we could be heard if we screamed ever
so!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Miss Matty, &ldquo;what has alarmed
you so much?&nbsp; Have you seen any men lurking about the
house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; answered Miss Pole.&nbsp; &ldquo;Two
very bad-looking men have gone three times past the house, very
slowly; and an Irish beggar-woman came not half-an-hour ago, and
all but forced herself in past Betty, saying her children were
starving, and she must speak to the mistress.&nbsp; You see, she
said &lsquo;mistress,&rsquo; though there was a hat hanging up in
the hall, and it would have been more natural to have said
&lsquo;master.&rsquo;&nbsp; But Betty shut the door in her face,
and came up to me, and we got the spoons together, and sat in the
parlour-window watching till we saw Thomas Jones going from his
work, when we called to him and asked him to take care of us into
the town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We might have triumphed over Miss Pole, who had professed such
bravery until she was frightened; but we were too glad to
perceive that she shared in the weaknesses of humanity to exult
over her; and I gave up my room to her very willingly, and shared
Miss Matty&rsquo;s bed for the night.&nbsp; But before we
retired, the two ladies rummaged up, out of the recesses of their
memory, such horrid stories of <a name="page147"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 147</span>robbery and murder that I quite
quaked in my shoes.&nbsp; Miss Pole was evidently anxious to
prove that such terrible events had occurred within her
experience that she was justified in her sudden panic; and Miss
Matty did not like to be outdone, and capped every story with one
yet more horrible, till it reminded me oddly enough, of an old
story I had read somewhere, of a nightingale and a musician, who
strove one against the other which could produce the most
admirable music, till poor Philomel dropped down dead.</p>
<p>One of the stories that haunted me for a long time afterwards
was of a girl who was left in charge of a great house in
Cumberland on some particular fair-day, when the other servants
all went off to the gaieties.&nbsp; The family were away in
London, and a pedlar came by, and asked to leave his large and
heavy pack in the kitchen, saying he would call for it again at
night; and the girl (a gamekeeper&rsquo;s daughter), roaming
about in search of amusement, chanced to hit upon a gun hanging
up in the hall, and took it down to look at the chasing; and it
went off through the open kitchen door, hit the pack, and a slow
dark thread of blood came oozing out. (How Miss Pole enjoyed this
part of the story, dwelling on each word as if she loved
it!)&nbsp; She rather hurried over the further account of the
girl&rsquo;s bravery, and I have but a confused idea that,
somehow, she baffled the robbers with Italian irons, heated
red-hot, and then restored to blackness by being dipped in
grease.</p>
<p>We parted for the night with an awe-stricken wonder as to what
we should hear of in the morning&mdash;and, on my part, with a
vehement desire for the night to be over and gone: I was so
afraid lest the <a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
148</span>robbers should have seen, from some dark lurking-place,
that Miss Pole had carried off her plate, and thus have a double
motive for attacking our house.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>But until Lady Glenmire came to call next day we heard of
nothing unusual.&nbsp; The kitchen fire-irons were in exactly the
same position against the back door as when Martha and I had
skilfully piled them up, like spillikins, ready to fall with an
awful clatter if only a cat had touched the outside panels.&nbsp;
I had wondered what we should all do if thus awakened and
alarmed, and had proposed to Miss Matty that we should cover up
our faces under the bedclothes so that there should be no danger
of the robbers thinking that we could identify them; but Miss
Matty, who was trembling very much, scouted this idea, and said
we owed it to society to apprehend them, and that she should
certainly do her best to lay hold of them and lock them up in the
garret till morning.</p>
<p>When Lady Glenmire came, we almost felt jealous of her.&nbsp;
Mrs Jamieson&rsquo;s house had really been attacked; at least
there were men&rsquo;s footsteps to be seen on the flower
borders, underneath the kitchen windows, &ldquo;where nae men
should be;&rdquo; and Carlo had barked all through the night as
if strangers were abroad.&nbsp; Mrs Jamieson had been awakened by
Lady Glenmire, and they had rung the bell which communicated with
Mr Mulliner&rsquo;s room in the third storey, and when his
night-capped head had appeared over the bannisters, in answer to
the summons, they had told him of their alarm, and the reasons
for it; whereupon he retreated into his bedroom, and locked the
door (for fear of draughts, as he informed them <a
name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 149</span>in the
morning), and opened the window, and called out valiantly to say,
if the supposed robbers would come to him he would fight them;
but, as Lady Glenmire observed, that was but poor comfort, since
they would have to pass by Mrs Jamieson&rsquo;s room and her own
before they could reach him, and must be of a very pugnacious
disposition indeed if they neglected the opportunities of robbery
presented by the unguarded lower storeys, to go up to a garret,
and there force a door in order to get at the champion of the
house.&nbsp; Lady Glenmire, after waiting and listening for some
time in the drawing-room, had proposed to Mrs Jamieson that they
should go to bed; but that lady said she should not feel
comfortable unless she sat up and watched; and, accordingly, she
packed herself warmly up on the sofa, where she was found by the
housemaid, when she came into the room at six o&rsquo;clock, fast
asleep; but Lady Glenmire went to bed, and kept awake all
night.</p>
<p>When Miss Pole heard of this, she nodded her head in great
satisfaction.&nbsp; She had been sure we should hear of something
happening in Cranford that night; and we had heard.&nbsp; It was
clear enough they had first proposed to attack her house; but
when they saw that she and Betty were on their guard, and had
carried off the plate, they had changed their tactics and gone to
Mrs Jamieson&rsquo;s, and no one knew what might have happened if
Carlo had not barked, like a good dog as he was!</p>
<p>Poor Carlo! his barking days were nearly over.&nbsp; Whether
the gang who infested the neighbourhood were afraid of him, or
whether they were revengeful enough, for the way in which he had
baffled them on <a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
150</span>the night in question, to poison him; or whether, as
some among the more uneducated people thought, he died of
apoplexy, brought on by too much feeding and too little exercise;
at any rate, it is certain that, two days after this eventful
night, Carlo was found dead, with his poor legs stretched out
stiff in the attitude of running, as if by such unusual exertion
he could escape the sure pursuer, Death.</p>
<p>We were all sorry for Carlo, the old familiar friend who had
snapped at us for so many years; and the mysterious mode of his
death made us very uncomfortable.&nbsp; Could Signor Brunoni be
at the bottom of this?&nbsp; He had apparently killed a canary
with only a word of command; his will seemed of deadly force; who
knew but what he might yet be lingering in the neighbourhood
willing all sorts of awful things!</p>
<p>We whispered these fancies among ourselves in the evenings;
but in the mornings our courage came back with the daylight, and
in a week&rsquo;s time we had got over the shock of Carlo&rsquo;s
death; all but Mrs Jamieson.&nbsp; She, poor thing, felt it as
she had felt no event since her husband&rsquo;s death; indeed,
Miss Pole said, that as the Honourable Mr Jamieson drank a good
deal, and occasioned her much uneasiness, it was possible that
Carlo&rsquo;s death might be the greater affliction.&nbsp; But
there was always a tinge of cynicism in Miss Pole&rsquo;s
remarks.&nbsp; However, one thing was clear and certain&mdash;it
was necessary for Mrs Jamieson to have some change of scene; and
Mr Mulliner was very impressive on this point, shaking his head
whenever we inquired after his mistress, and speaking of her loss
of appetite and bad nights very ominously; <a
name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>and with
justice too, for if she had two characteristics in her natural
state of health they were a facility of eating and
sleeping.&nbsp; If she could neither eat nor sleep, she must be
indeed out of spirits and out of health.</p>
<p>Lady Glenmire (who had evidently taken very kindly to
Cranford) did not like the idea of Mrs Jamieson&rsquo;s going to
Cheltenham, and more than once insinuated pretty plainly that it
was Mr Mulliner&rsquo;s doing, who had been much alarmed on the
occasion of the house being attacked, and since had said, more
than once, that he felt it a very responsible charge to have to
defend so many women.&nbsp; Be that as it might, Mrs Jamieson
went to Cheltenham, escorted by Mr Mulliner; and Lady Glenmire
remained in possession of the house, her ostensible office being
to take care that the maid-servants did not pick up
followers.&nbsp; She made a very pleasant-looking dragon; and, as
soon as it was arranged for her stay in Cranford, she found out
that Mrs Jamieson&rsquo;s visit to Cheltenham was just the best
thing in the world.&nbsp; She had let her house in Edinburgh, and
was for the time house-less, so the charge of her
sister-in-law&rsquo;s comfortable abode was very convenient and
acceptable.</p>
<p>Miss Pole was very much inclined to instal herself as a
heroine, because of the decided steps she had taken in flying
from the two men and one woman, whom she entitled &ldquo;that
murderous gang.&rdquo;&nbsp; She described their appearance in
glowing colours, and I noticed that every time she went over the
story some fresh trait of villainy was added to their
appearance.&nbsp; One was tall&mdash;he grew to be gigantic in
height before we had done with him; he of course <a
name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>had black
hair&mdash;and by-and-by it hung in elf-locks over his forehead
and down his back.&nbsp; The other was short and broad&mdash;and
a hump sprouted out on his shoulder before we heard the last of
him; he had red hair&mdash;which deepened into carroty; and she
was almost sure he had a cast in the eye&mdash;a decided
squint.&nbsp; As for the woman, her eyes glared, and she was
masculine-looking&mdash;a perfect virago; most probably a man
dressed in woman&rsquo;s clothes; afterwards, we heard of a beard
on her chin, and a manly voice and a stride.</p>
<p>If Miss Pole was delighted to recount the events of that
afternoon to all inquirers, others were not so proud of their
adventures in the robbery line.&nbsp; Mr Hoggins, the surgeon,
had been attacked at his own door by two ruffians, who were
concealed in the shadow of the porch, and so effectually silenced
him that he was robbed in the interval between ringing his bell
and the servant&rsquo;s answering it.&nbsp; Miss Pole was sure it
would turn out that this robbery had been committed by &ldquo;her
men,&rdquo; and went the very day she heard the report to have
her teeth examined, and to question Mr Hoggins.&nbsp; She came to
us afterwards; so we heard what she had heard, straight and
direct from the source, while we were yet in the excitement and
flutter of the agitation caused by the first intelligence; for
the event had only occurred the night before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said Miss Pole, sitting down with the
decision of a person who has made up her mind as to the nature of
life and the world (and such people never tread lightly, or seat
themselves without a bump), &ldquo;well, Miss Matty! men will be
men.&nbsp; <a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
153</span>Every mother&rsquo;s son of them wishes to be
considered Samson and Solomon rolled into one&mdash;too strong
ever to be beaten or discomfited&mdash;too wise ever to be
outwitted.&nbsp; If you will notice, they have always foreseen
events, though they never tell one for one&rsquo;s warning before
the events happen.&nbsp; My father was a man, and I know the sex
pretty well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had talked herself out of breath, and we should have been
very glad to fill up the necessary pause as chorus, but we did
not exactly know what to say, or which man had suggested this
diatribe against the sex; so we only joined in generally, with a
grave shake of the head, and a soft murmur of &ldquo;They are
very incomprehensible, certainly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, only think,&rdquo; said she.&nbsp; &ldquo;There, I
have undergone the risk of having one of my remaining teeth drawn
(for one is terribly at the mercy of any surgeon-dentist; and I,
for one, always speak them fair till I have got my mouth out of
their clutches), and, after all, Mr Hoggins is too much of a man
to own that he was robbed last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not robbed!&rdquo; exclaimed the chorus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me!&rdquo; Miss Pole exclaimed, angry
that we could be for a moment imposed upon.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
believe he was robbed, just as Betty told me, and he is ashamed
to own it; and, to be sure, it was very silly of him to be robbed
just at his own door; I daresay he feels that such a thing
won&rsquo;t raise him in the eyes of Cranford society, and is
anxious to conceal it&mdash;but he need not have tried to impose
upon me, by saying I must have heard an exaggerated account of
some petty theft of a neck of mutton, which, it seems, was stolen
out of the safe in his <a name="page154"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 154</span>yard last week; he had the
impertinence to add, he believed that that was taken by the
cat.&nbsp; I have no doubt, if I could get at the bottom of it,
it was that Irishman dressed up in woman&rsquo;s clothes, who
came spying about my house, with the story about the starving
children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After we had duly condemned the want of candour which Mr
Hoggins had evinced, and abused men in general, taking him for
the representative and type, we got round to the subject about
which we had been talking when Miss Pole came in; namely, how
far, in the present disturbed state of the country, we could
venture to accept an invitation which Miss Matty had just
received from Mrs Forrester, to come as usual and keep the
anniversary of her wedding-day by drinking tea with her at five
o&rsquo;clock, and playing a quiet pool afterwards.&nbsp; Mrs
Forrester had said that she asked us with some diffidence,
because the roads were, she feared, very unsafe.&nbsp; But she
suggested that perhaps one of us would not object to take the
sedan, and that the others, by walking briskly, might keep up
with the long trot of the chairmen, and so we might all arrive
safely at Over Place, a suburb of the town.&nbsp; (No; that is
too large an expression: a small cluster of houses separated from
Cranford by about two hundred yards of a dark and lonely
lane.)&nbsp; There was no doubt but that a similar note was
awaiting Miss Pole at home; so her call was a very fortunate
affair, as it enabled us to consult together.&nbsp; We would all
much rather have declined this invitation; but we felt that it
would not be quite kind to Mrs Forrester, who would otherwise be
left to a solitary retrospect of her not <a
name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>very happy
or fortunate life.&nbsp; Miss Matty and Miss Pole had been
visitors on this occasion for many years, and now they gallantly
determined to nail their colours to the mast, and to go through
Darkness Lane rather than fail in loyalty to their friend.</p>
<p>But when the evening came, Miss Matty (for it was she who was
voted into the chair, as she had a cold), before being shut down
in the sedan, like jack-in-a-box, implored the chairmen, whatever
might befall, not to run away and leave her fastened up there, to
be murdered; and even after they had promised, I saw her tighten
her features into the stern determination of a martyr, and she
gave me a melancholy and ominous shake of the head through the
glass.&nbsp; However, we got there safely, only rather out of
breath, for it was who could trot hardest through Darkness Lane,
and I am afraid poor Miss Matty was sadly jolted.</p>
<p>Mrs Forrester had made extra preparations, in acknowledgment
of our exertion in coming to see her through such dangers.&nbsp;
The usual forms of genteel ignorance as to what her servants
might send up were all gone through; and harmony and Preference
seemed likely to be the order of the evening, but for an
interesting conversation that began I don&rsquo;t know how, but
which had relation, of course, to the robbers who infested the
neighbourhood of Cranford.</p>
<p>Having braved the dangers of Darkness Lane, and thus having a
little stock of reputation for courage to fall back upon; and
also, I daresay, desirous of proving ourselves superior to men
(<i>videlicet</i> Mr Hoggins) in the article of candour, we <a
name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>began to
relate our individual fears, and the private precautions we each
of us took.&nbsp; I owned that my pet apprehension was
eyes&mdash;eyes looking at me, and watching me, glittering out
from some dull, flat, wooden surface; and that if I dared to go
up to my looking-glass when I was panic-stricken, I should
certainly turn it round, with its back towards me, for fear of
seeing eyes behind me looking out of the darkness.&nbsp; I saw
Miss Matty nerving herself up for a confession; and at last out
it came.&nbsp; She owned that, ever since she had been a girl,
she had dreaded being caught by her last leg, just as she was
getting into bed, by some one concealed under it.&nbsp; She said,
when she was younger and more active, she used to take a flying
leap from a distance, and so bring both her legs up safely into
bed at once; but that this had always annoyed Deborah, who piqued
herself upon getting into bed gracefully, and she had given it up
in consequence.&nbsp; But now the old terror would often come
over her, especially since Miss Pole&rsquo;s house had been
attacked (we had got quite to believe in the fact of the attack
having taken place), and yet it was very unpleasant to think of
looking under a bed, and seeing a man concealed, with a great,
fierce face staring out at you; so she had bethought herself of
something&mdash;perhaps I had noticed that she had told Martha to
buy her a penny ball, such as children play with&mdash;and now
she rolled this ball under the bed every night: if it came out on
the other side, well and good; if not she always took care to
have her hand on the bell-rope, and meant to call out John and
Harry, just as if she expected men-servants to answer her
ring.</p>
<p><a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>We
all applauded this ingenious contrivance, and Miss Matty sank
back into satisfied silence, with a look at Mrs Forrester as if
to ask for <i>her</i> private weakness.</p>
<p>Mrs Forrester looked askance at Miss Pole, and tried to change
the subject a little by telling us that she had borrowed a boy
from one of the neighbouring cottages and promised his parents a
hundredweight of coals at Christmas, and his supper every
evening, for the loan of him at nights.&nbsp; She had instructed
him in his possible duties when he first came; and, finding him
sensible, she had given him the Major&rsquo;s sword (the Major
was her late husband), and desired him to put it very carefully
behind his pillow at night, turning the edge towards the head of
the pillow.&nbsp; He was a sharp lad, she was sure; for, spying
out the Major&rsquo;s cocked hat, he had said, if he might have
that to wear, he was sure he could frighten two Englishmen, or
four Frenchmen any day.&nbsp; But she had impressed upon him anew
that he was to lose no time in putting on hats or anything else;
but, if he heard any noise, he was to run at it with his drawn
sword.&nbsp; On my suggesting that some accident might occur from
such slaughterous and indiscriminate directions, and that he
might rush on Jenny getting up to wash, and have spitted her
before he had discovered that she was not a Frenchman, Mrs
Forrester said she did not think that that was likely, for he was
a very sound sleeper, and generally had to be well shaken or
cold-pigged in a morning before they could rouse him.&nbsp; She
sometimes thought such dead sleep must be owing to the hearty
suppers the poor lad ate, for he was <a name="page158"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 158</span>half-starved at home, and she told
Jenny to see that he got a good meal at night.</p>

<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>Still this was no confession of Mrs Forrester&rsquo;s peculiar
timidity, and we urged her to tell us what she thought would
frighten her more than anything.&nbsp; She paused, and stirred
the fire, and snuffed the candles, and then she said, in a
sounding whisper&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ghosts!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at Miss Pole, as much as to say, she had declared
it, and would stand by it.&nbsp; Such a look was a challenge in
itself.&nbsp; Miss Pole came down upon her with indigestion,
spectral illusions, optical delusions, and a great deal out of Dr
Ferrier and Dr Hibbert besides.&nbsp; Miss Matty had rather a
leaning to ghosts, as I have mentioned before, and what little
she did say was all on Mrs Forrester&rsquo;s side, who,
emboldened by sympathy, protested that ghosts were a part of her
religion; that surely she, the widow of a major in the army, knew
what to be frightened at, and what not; in short, I never saw Mrs
Forrester so warm either before or since, for she was a gentle,
meek, enduring old lady in most things.&nbsp; Not all the
elder-wine that ever was mulled could this night wash out the
remembrance of this difference between Miss Pole and her
hostess.&nbsp; Indeed, when the elder-wine was brought in, it
gave rise to a new burst of discussion; for Jenny, the little
maiden who staggered under the tray, had to give evidence of
having seen a ghost with her own eyes, not so many nights ago, in
Darkness Lane, the very lane we were to go through on our way
home.</p>
<p>In spite of the uncomfortable feeling which this last
consideration gave me, I could not help being <a
name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 159</span>amused at
Jenny&rsquo;s position, which was exceedingly like that of a
witness being examined and cross-examined by two counsel who are
not at all scrupulous about asking leading questions.&nbsp; The
conclusion I arrived at was, that Jenny had certainly seen
something beyond what a fit of indigestion would have
caused.&nbsp; A lady all in white, and without her head, was what
she deposed and adhered to, supported by a consciousness of the
secret sympathy of her mistress under the withering scorn with
which Miss Pole regarded her.&nbsp; And not only she, but many
others, had seen this headless lady, who sat by the roadside
wringing her hands as in deep grief.&nbsp; Mrs Forrester looked
at us from time to time with an air of conscious triumph; but
then she had not to pass through Darkness Lane before she could
bury herself beneath her own familiar bed-clothes.</p>
<p>We preserved a discreet silence as to the headless lady while
we were putting on our things to go home, for there was no
knowing how near the ghostly head and ears might be, or what
spiritual connection they might be keeping up with the unhappy
body in Darkness Lane; and, therefore, even Miss Pole felt that
it was as well not to speak lightly on such subjects, for fear of
vexing or insulting that woebegone trunk.&nbsp; At least, so I
conjecture; for, instead of the busy clatter usual in the
operation, we tied on our cloaks as sadly as mutes at a
funeral.&nbsp; Miss Matty drew the curtains round the windows of
the chair to shut out disagreeable sights, and the men (either
because they were in spirits that their labours were so nearly
ended, or <a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
160</span>because they were going down hill), set off at such a
round and merry pace, that it was all Miss Pole and I could do to
keep up with them.&nbsp; She had breath for nothing beyond an
imploring &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t leave me!&rdquo; uttered as she
clutched my arm so tightly that I could not have quitted her,
ghost or no ghost.&nbsp; What a relief it was when the men, weary
of their burden and their quick trot, stopped just where
Headingley Causeway branches off from Darkness Lane!&nbsp; Miss
Pole unloosed me and caught at one of the men&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could not you&mdash;could not you take Miss Matty round
by Headingley Causeway?&mdash;the pavement in Darkness Lane jolts
so, and she is not very strong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A smothered voice was heard from the inside of the
chair&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! pray go on!&nbsp; What is the matter?&nbsp; What is
the matter?&nbsp; I will give you sixpence more to go on very
fast; pray don&rsquo;t stop here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll give you a shilling,&rdquo; said Miss
Pole, with tremulous dignity, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;ll go by
Headingley Causeway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two men grunted acquiescence and took up the chair, and
went along the causeway, which certainly answered Miss
Pole&rsquo;s kind purpose of saving Miss Matty&rsquo;s bones; for
it was covered with soft, thick mud, and even a fall there would
have been easy till the getting-up came, when there might have
been some difficulty in extrication.</p>

161</span>CHAPTER XI&mdash;SAMUEL BROWN</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next morning I met Lady
Glenmire and Miss Pole setting out on a long walk to find some
old woman who was famous in the neighbourhood for her skill in
knitting woollen stockings.&nbsp; Miss Pole said to me, with a
smile half-kindly and half-contemptuous upon her countenance,
&ldquo;I have been just telling Lady Glenmire of our poor friend
Mrs Forrester, and her terror of ghosts.&nbsp; It comes from
living so much alone, and listening to the bug-a-boo stories of
that Jenny of hers.&rdquo;&nbsp; She was so calm and so much
above superstitious fears herself that I was almost ashamed to
say how glad I had been of her Headingley Causeway proposition
the night before, and turned off the conversation to something
else.</p>
<p>In the afternoon Miss Pole called on Miss Matty to tell her of
the adventure&mdash;the real adventure they had met with on their
morning&rsquo;s walk.&nbsp; They had been perplexed about the
exact path which they were to take across the fields in order to
find the knitting old woman, and had stopped to inquire at a
little wayside public-house, standing on the high road to London,
about three miles from Cranford.&nbsp; <a
name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>The good
woman had asked them to sit down and rest themselves while she
fetched her husband, who could direct them better than she could;
and, while they were sitting in the sanded parlour, a little girl
came in.&nbsp; They thought that she belonged to the landlady,
and began some trifling conversation with her; but, on Mrs
Roberts&rsquo;s return, she told them that the little thing was
the only child of a couple who were staying in the house.&nbsp;
And then she began a long story, out of which Lady Glenmire and
Miss Pole could only gather one or two decided facts, which were
that, about six weeks ago, a light spring-cart had broken down
just before their door, in which there were two men, one woman,
and this child.&nbsp; One of the men was seriously hurt&mdash;no
bones broken, only &ldquo;shaken,&rdquo; the landlady called it;
but he had probably sustained some severe internal injury, for he
had languished in their house ever since, attended by his wife,
the mother of this little girl.&nbsp; Miss Pole had asked what he
was, what he looked like.&nbsp; And Mrs Roberts had made answer
that he was not like a gentleman, nor yet like a common person;
if it had not been that he and his wife were such decent, quiet
people, she could almost have thought he was a mountebank, or
something of that kind, for they had a great box in the cart,
full of she did not know what.&nbsp; She had helped to unpack it,
and take out their linen and clothes, when the other
man&mdash;his twin-brother, she believed he was&mdash;had gone
off with the horse and cart.</p>
<p>Miss Pole had begun to have her suspicions at this point, and
expressed her idea that it was rather strange that the box and
cart and horse and all should <a name="page163"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 163</span>have disappeared; but good Mrs
Roberts seemed to have become quite indignant at Miss
Pole&rsquo;s implied suggestion; in fact, Miss Pole said she was
as angry as if Miss Pole had told her that she herself was a
swindler.&nbsp; As the best way of convincing the ladies, she
bethought her of begging them to see the wife; and, as Miss Pole
said, there was no doubting the honest, worn, bronzed face of the
woman, who at the first tender word from Lady Glenmire, burst
into tears, which she was too weak to check until some word from
the landlady made her swallow down her sobs, in order that she
might testify to the Christian kindness shown by Mr and Mrs
Roberts.&nbsp; Miss Pole came round with a swing to as vehement a
belief in the sorrowful tale as she had been sceptical before;
and, as a proof of this, her energy in the poor sufferer&rsquo;s
behalf was nothing daunted when she found out that he, and no
other, was our Signor Brunoni, to whom all Cranford had been
attributing all manner of evil this six weeks past!&nbsp; Yes!
his wife said his proper name was Samuel
Brown&mdash;&ldquo;Sam,&rdquo; she called him&mdash;but to the
last we preferred calling him &ldquo;the Signor&rdquo;; it
sounded so much better.</p>
<p>The end of their conversation with the Signora Brunoni was
that it was agreed that he should be placed under medical advice,
and for any expense incurred in procuring this Lady Glenmire
promised to hold herself responsible, and had accordingly gone to
Mr Hoggins to beg him to ride over to the &ldquo;Rising
Sun&rdquo; that very afternoon, and examine into the
signor&rsquo;s real state; and, as Miss Pole said, if it was
desirable to remove him to Cranford to be more immediately under
Mr Hoggins&rsquo;s eye, she would <a name="page164"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 164</span>undertake to see for lodgings and
arrange about the rent.&nbsp; Mrs Roberts had been as kind as
could be all throughout, but it was evident that their long
residence there had been a slight inconvenience.</p>
<p>Before Miss Pole left us, Miss Matty and I were as full of the
morning&rsquo;s adventure as she was.&nbsp; We talked about it
all the evening, turning it in every possible light, and we went
to bed anxious for the morning, when we should surely hear from
someone what Mr Hoggins thought and recommended; for, as Miss
Matty observed, though Mr Hoggins did say &ldquo;Jack&rsquo;s
up,&rdquo; &ldquo;a fig for his heels,&rdquo; and called
Preference &ldquo;Pref.&rdquo; she believed he was a very worthy
man and a very clever surgeon.&nbsp; Indeed, we were rather proud
of our doctor at Cranford, as a doctor.&nbsp; We often wished,
when we heard of Queen Adelaide or the Duke of Wellington being
ill, that they would send for Mr Hoggins; but, on consideration,
we were rather glad they did not, for, if we were ailing, what
should we do if Mr Hoggins had been appointed
physician-in-ordinary to the Royal Family?&nbsp; As a surgeon we
were proud of him; but as a man&mdash;or rather, I should say, as
a gentleman&mdash;we could only shake our heads over his name and
himself, and wished that he had read Lord Chesterfield&rsquo;s
Letters in the days when his manners were susceptible of
improvement.&nbsp; Nevertheless, we all regarded his dictum in
the signor&rsquo;s case as infallible, and when he said that with
care and attention he might rally, we had no more fear for
him.</p>
<p>But, although we had no more fear, everybody did as much as if
there was great cause for anxiety&mdash;as indeed there was until
Mr Hoggins took charge of <a name="page165"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 165</span>him.&nbsp; Miss Pole looked out
clean and comfortable, if homely, lodgings; Miss Matty sent the
sedan-chair for him, and Martha and I aired it well before it
left Cranford by holding a warming-pan full of red-hot coals in
it, and then shutting it up close, smoke and all, until the time
when he should get into it at the &ldquo;Rising Sun.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Lady Glenmire undertook the medical department under Mr
Hoggins&rsquo;s directions, and rummaged up all Mrs
Jamieson&rsquo;s medicine glasses, and spoons, and bed-tables, in
a free-and-easy way, that made Miss Matty feel a little anxious
as to what that lady and Mr Mulliner might say, if they
knew.&nbsp; Mrs Forrester made some of the bread-jelly, for which
she was so famous, to have ready as a refreshment in the lodgings
when he should arrive.&nbsp; A present of this bread-jelly was
the highest mark of favour dear Mrs Forrester could confer.&nbsp;
Miss Pole had once asked her for the receipt, but she had met
with a very decided rebuff; that lady told her that she could not
part with it to any one during her life, and that after her death
it was bequeathed, as her executors would find, to Miss
Matty.&nbsp; What Miss Matty, or, as Mrs Forrester called her
(remembering the clause in her will and the dignity of the
occasion), Miss Matilda Jenkyns&mdash;might choose to do with the
receipt when it came into her possession&mdash;whether to make it
public, or to hand it down as an heirloom&mdash;she did not know,
nor would she dictate.&nbsp; And a mould of this admirable,
digestible, unique bread-jelly was sent by Mrs Forrester to our
poor sick conjuror.&nbsp; Who says that the aristocracy are
proud?&nbsp; Here was a lady by birth a Tyrrell, and descended
from the great Sir Walter that shot King Rufus, and in whose
veins ran the <a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
166</span>blood of him who murdered the little princes in the
Tower, going every day to see what dainty dishes she could
prepare for Samuel Brown, a mountebank!&nbsp; But, indeed, it was
wonderful to see what kind feelings were called out by this poor
man&rsquo;s coming amongst us.&nbsp; And also wonderful to see
how the great Cranford panic, which had been occasioned by his
first coming in his Turkish dress, melted away into thin air on
his second coming&mdash;pale and feeble, and with his heavy,
filmy eyes, that only brightened a very little when they fell
upon the countenance of his faithful wife, or their pale and
sorrowful little girl.</p>
<p>Somehow we all forgot to be afraid.&nbsp; I daresay it was
that finding out that he, who had first excited our love of the
marvellous by his unprecedented arts, had not sufficient
every-day gifts to manage a shying horse, made us feel as if we
were ourselves again.&nbsp; Miss Pole came with her little basket
at all hours of the evening, as if her lonely house and the
unfrequented road to it had never been infested by that
&ldquo;murderous gang&rdquo;; Mrs Forrester said she thought that
neither Jenny nor she need mind the headless lady who wept and
wailed in Darkness Lane, for surely the power was never given to
such beings to harm those who went about to try to do what little
good was in their power, to which Jenny tremblingly assented; but
the mistress&rsquo;s theory had little effect on the maid&rsquo;s
practice until she had sewn two pieces of red flannel in the
shape of a cross on her inner garment.</p>
<p>I found Miss Matty covering her penny ball&mdash;the ball that
she used to roll under her bed&mdash;with gay-coloured worsted in
rainbow stripes.</p>
<p><a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
167</span>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;my heart is sad
for that little careworn child.&nbsp; Although her father is a
conjuror, she looks as if she had never had a good game of play
in her life.&nbsp; I used to make very pretty balls in this way
when I was a girl, and I thought I would try if I could not make
this one smart and take it to Phoebe this afternoon.&nbsp; I
think &lsquo;the gang&rsquo; must have left the neighbourhood,
for one does not hear any more of their violence and robbery
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We were all of us far too full of the signor&rsquo;s
precarious state to talk either about robbers or ghosts.&nbsp;
Indeed, Lady Glenmire said she never had heard of any actual
robberies, except that two little boys had stolen some apples
from Farmer Benson&rsquo;s orchard, and that some eggs had been
missed on a market-day off Widow Hayward&rsquo;s stall.&nbsp; But
that was expecting too much of us; we could not acknowledge that
we had only had this small foundation for all our panic.&nbsp;
Miss Pole drew herself up at this remark of Lady
Glenmire&rsquo;s, and said &ldquo;that she wished she could agree
with her as to the very small reason we had had for alarm, but
with the recollection of a man disguised as a woman who had
endeavoured to force himself into her house while his
confederates waited outside; with the knowledge gained from Lady
Glenmire herself, of the footprints seen on Mrs Jamieson&rsquo;s
flower borders; with the fact before her of the audacious robbery
committed on Mr Hoggins at his own door&rdquo;&mdash;But here
Lady Glenmire broke in with a very strong expression of doubt as
to whether this last story was not an entire fabrication founded
upon the theft of a cat; she grew <a name="page168"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 168</span>so red while she was saying all this
that I was not surprised at Miss Pole&rsquo;s manner of bridling
up, and I am certain, if Lady Glenmire had not been &ldquo;her
ladyship,&rdquo; we should have had a more emphatic contradiction
than the &ldquo;Well, to be sure!&rdquo; and similar fragmentary
ejaculations, which were all that she ventured upon in my
lady&rsquo;s presence.&nbsp; But when she was gone Miss Pole
began a long congratulation to Miss Matty that so far they had
escaped marriage, which she noticed always made people credulous
to the last degree; indeed, she thought it argued great natural
credulity in a woman if she could not keep herself from being
married; and in what Lady Glenmire had said about Mr
Hoggins&rsquo;s robbery we had a specimen of what people came to
if they gave way to such a weakness; evidently Lady Glenmire
would swallow anything if she could believe the poor vamped-up
story about a neck of mutton and a pussy with which he had tried
to impose on Miss Pole, only she had always been on her guard
against believing too much of what men said.</p>
<p>We were thankful, as Miss Pole desired us to be, that we had
never been married; but I think, of the two, we were even more
thankful that the robbers had left Cranford; at least I judge so
from a speech of Miss Matty&rsquo;s that evening, as we sat over
the fire, in which she evidently looked upon a husband as a great
protector against thieves, burglars, and ghosts; and said that
she did not think that she should dare to be always warning young
people against matrimony, as Miss Pole did continually; to be
sure, marriage was a risk, as she saw, now she had had some
experience; but she remembered the <a name="page169"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 169</span>time when she had looked forward to
being married as much as any one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to any particular person, my dear,&rdquo; said she,
hastily checking herself up, as if she were afraid of having
admitted too much; &ldquo;only the old story, you know, of ladies
always saying, &lsquo;<i>When</i> I marry,&rsquo; and gentlemen,
&lsquo;<i>If</i> I marry.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; It was a joke
spoken in rather a sad tone, and I doubt if either of us smiled;
but I could not see Miss Matty&rsquo;s face by the flickering
fire-light.&nbsp; In a little while she continued&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, after all, I have not told you the truth.&nbsp; It
is so long ago, and no one ever knew how much I thought of it at
the time, unless, indeed, my dear mother guessed; but I may say
that there was a time when I did not think I should have been
only Miss Matty Jenkyns all my life; for even if I did meet with
any one who wished to marry me now (and, as Miss Pole says, one
is never too safe), I could not take him&mdash;I hope he would
not take it too much to heart, but I could <i>not</i> take
him&mdash;or any one but the person I once thought I should be
married to; and he is dead and gone, and he never knew how it all
came about that I said &lsquo;No,&rsquo; when I had thought many
and many a time&mdash;Well, it&rsquo;s no matter what I
thought.&nbsp; God ordains it all, and I am very happy, my
dear.&nbsp; No one has such kind friends as I,&rdquo; continued
she, taking my hand and holding it in hers.</p>
<p>If I had never known of Mr Holbrook, I could have said
something in this pause, but as I had, I could not think of
anything that would come in naturally, and so we both kept
silence for a little time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father once made us,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;keep a
<a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 170</span>diary,
in two columns; on one side we were to put down in the morning
what we thought would be the course and events of the coming day,
and at night we were to put down on the other side what really
had happened.&nbsp; It would be to some people rather a sad way
of telling their lives,&rdquo; (a tear dropped upon my hand at
these words)&mdash;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean that mine has been
sad, only so very different to what I expected.&nbsp; I remember,
one winter&rsquo;s evening, sitting over our bedroom fire with
Deborah&mdash;I remember it as if it were yesterday&mdash;and we
were planning our future lives, both of us were planning, though
only she talked about it.&nbsp; She said she should like to marry
an archdeacon, and write his charges; and you know, my dear, she
never was married, and, for aught I know, she never spoke to an
unmarried archdeacon in her life.&nbsp; I never was ambitious,
nor could I have written charges, but I thought I could manage a
house (my mother used to call me her right hand), and I was
always so fond of little children&mdash;the shyest babies would
stretch out their little arms to come to me; when I was a girl, I
was half my leisure time nursing in the neighbouring cottages;
but I don&rsquo;t know how it was, when I grew sad and
grave&mdash;which I did a year or two after this time&mdash;the
little things drew back from me, and I am afraid I lost the
knack, though I am just as fond of children as ever, and have a
strange yearning at my heart whenever I see a mother with her
baby in her arms.&nbsp; Nay, my dear&rdquo; (and by a sudden
blaze which sprang up from a fall of the unstirred coals, I saw
that her eyes were full of tears&mdash;gazing intently on some
vision of what might have been), &ldquo;do you know I dream
sometimes <a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
171</span>that I have a little child&mdash;always the
same&mdash;a little girl of about two years old; she never grows
older, though I have dreamt about her for many years.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t think I ever dream of any words or sound she makes;
she is very noiseless and still, but she comes to me when she is
very sorry or very glad, and I have wakened with the clasp of her
dear little arms round my neck.&nbsp; Only last
night&mdash;perhaps because I had gone to sleep thinking of this
ball for Phoebe&mdash;my little darling came in my dream, and put
up her mouth to be kissed, just as I have seen real babies do to
real mothers before going to bed.&nbsp; But all this is nonsense,
dear! only don&rsquo;t be frightened by Miss Pole from being
married.&nbsp; I can fancy it may be a very happy state, and a
little credulity helps one on through life very
smoothly&mdash;better than always doubting and doubting and
seeing difficulties and disagreeables in everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If I had been inclined to be daunted from matrimony, it would
not have been Miss Pole to do it; it would have been the lot of
poor Signor Brunoni and his wife.&nbsp; And yet again, it was an
encouragement to see how, through all their cares and sorrows,
they thought of each other and not of themselves; and how keen
were their joys, if they only passed through each other, or
through the little Phoebe.</p>
<p>The signora told me, one day, a good deal about their lives up
to this period.&nbsp; It began by my asking her whether Miss
Pole&rsquo;s story of the twin-brothers were true; it sounded so
wonderful a likeness, that I should have had my doubts, if Miss
Pole had not been unmarried.&nbsp; But the signora, or (as we
found <a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
172</span>out she preferred to be called) Mrs Brown, said it was
quite true; that her brother-in-law was by many taken for her
husband, which was of great assistance to them in their
profession; &ldquo;though,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;how
people can mistake Thomas for the real Signor Brunoni, I
can&rsquo;t conceive; but he says they do; so I suppose I must
believe him.&nbsp; Not but what he is a very good man; I am sure
I don&rsquo;t know how we should have paid our bill at the
&lsquo;Rising Sun&rsquo; but for the money he sends; but people
must know very little about art if they can take him for my
husband.&nbsp; Why, Miss, in the ball trick, where my husband
spreads his fingers wide, and throws out his little finger with
quite an air and a grace, Thomas just clumps up his hand like a
fist, and might have ever so many balls hidden in it.&nbsp;
Besides, he has never been in India, and knows nothing of the
proper sit of a turban.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you been in India?&rdquo; said I, rather
astonished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes! many a year, ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; Sam was a
sergeant in the 31st; and when the regiment was ordered to India,
I drew a lot to go, and I was more thankful than I can tell; for
it seemed as if it would only be a slow death to me to part from
my husband.&nbsp; But, indeed, ma&rsquo;am, if I had known all, I
don&rsquo;t know whether I would not rather have died there and
then than gone through what I have done since.&nbsp; To be sure,
I&rsquo;ve been able to comfort Sam, and to be with him; but,
ma&rsquo;am, I&rsquo;ve lost six children,&rdquo; said she,
looking up at me with those strange eyes that I&rsquo;ve never
noticed but in mothers of dead children&mdash;with a kind of wild
look in them, as if seeking for what <a name="page173"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 173</span>they never more might find.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes!&nbsp; Six children died off, like little buds nipped
untimely, in that cruel India.&nbsp; I thought, as each died, I
never could&mdash;I never would&mdash;love a child again; and
when the next came, it had not only its own love, but the deeper
love that came from the thoughts of its little dead brothers and
sisters.&nbsp; And when Phoebe was coming, I said to my husband,
&lsquo;Sam, when the child is born, and I am strong, I shall
leave you; it will cut my heart cruel; but if this baby dies too,
I shall go mad; the madness is in me now; but if you let me go
down to Calcutta, carrying my baby step by step, it will, maybe,
work itself off; and I will save, and I will hoard, and I will
beg&mdash;and I will die, to get a passage home to England, where
our baby may live?&rsquo;&nbsp; God bless him! he said I might
go; and he saved up his pay, and I saved every pice I could get
for washing or any way; and when Phoebe came, and I grew strong
again, I set off.&nbsp; It was very lonely; through the thick
forests, dark again with their heavy trees&mdash;along by the
river&rsquo;s side (but I had been brought up near the Avon in
Warwickshire, so that flowing noise sounded like home)&mdash;from
station to station, from Indian village to village, I went along,
carrying my child.&nbsp; I had seen one of the officer&rsquo;s
ladies with a little picture, ma&rsquo;am&mdash;done by a
Catholic foreigner, ma&rsquo;am&mdash;of the Virgin and the
little Saviour, ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; She had him on her arm, and
her form was softly curled round him, and their cheeks
touched.&nbsp; Well, when I went to bid good-bye to this lady,
for whom I had washed, she cried sadly; for she, too, had lost
her children, but she had not another to save, like me; and I was
bold enough to ask her would she <a name="page174"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 174</span>give me that print.&nbsp; And she
cried the more, and said her children were with that little
blessed Jesus; and gave it me, and told me that she had heard it
had been painted on the bottom of a cask, which made it have that
round shape.&nbsp; And when my body was very weary, and my heart
was sick (for there were times when I misdoubted if I could ever
reach my home, and there were times when I thought of my husband,
and one time when I thought my baby was dying), I took out that
picture and looked at it, till I could have thought the mother
spoke to me, and comforted me.&nbsp; And the natives were very
kind.&nbsp; We could not understand one another; but they saw my
baby on my breast, and they came out to me, and brought me rice
and milk, and sometimes flowers&mdash;I have got some of the
flowers dried.&nbsp; Then, the next morning, I was so tired; and
they wanted me to stay with them&mdash;I could tell
that&mdash;and tried to frighten me from going into the deep
woods, which, indeed, looked very strange and dark; but it seemed
to me as if Death was following me to take my baby away from me;
and as if I must go on, and on&mdash;and I thought how God had
cared for mothers ever since the world was made, and would care
for me; so I bade them good-bye, and set off afresh.&nbsp; And
once when my baby was ill, and both she and I needed rest, He led
me to a place where I found a kind Englishman lived, right in the
midst of the natives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you reached Calcutta safely at last?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, safely!&nbsp; Oh! when I knew I had only two
days&rsquo; journey more before me, I could not help it,
ma&rsquo;am&mdash;it might be idolatry, I cannot tell&mdash;but I
was near one of the native temples, and I went into <a
name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>it with my
baby to thank God for His great mercy; for it seemed to me that
where others had prayed before to their God, in their joy or in
their agony, was of itself a sacred place.&nbsp; And I got as
servant to an invalid lady, who grew quite fond of my baby
aboard-ship; and, in two years&rsquo; time, Sam earned his
discharge, and came home to me, and to our child.&nbsp; Then he
had to fix on a trade; but he knew of none; and once, once upon a
time, he had learnt some tricks from an Indian juggler; so he set
up conjuring, and it answered so well that he took Thomas to help
him&mdash;as his man, you know, not as another conjuror, though
Thomas has set it up now on his own hook.&nbsp; But it has been a
great help to us that likeness between the twins, and made a good
many tricks go off well that they made up together.&nbsp; And
Thomas is a good brother, only he has not the fine carriage of my
husband, so that I can&rsquo;t think how he can be taken for
Signor Brunoni himself, as he says he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor little Phoebe!&rdquo; said I, my thoughts going
back to the baby she carried all those hundred miles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! you may say so!&nbsp; I never thought I should have
reared her, though, when she fell ill at Chunderabaddad; but that
good, kind Aga Jenkyns took us in, which I believe was the very
saving of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jenkyns!&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Jenkyns.&nbsp; I shall think all people of that
name are kind; for here is that nice old lady who comes every day
to take Phoebe a walk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But an idea had flashed through my head; <a
name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>could the
Aga Jenkyns be the lost Peter?&nbsp; True he was reported by many
to be dead.&nbsp; But, equally true, some had said that he had
arrived at the dignity of Great Lama of Thibet.&nbsp; Miss Matty
thought he was alive.&nbsp; I would make further inquiry.</p>
<h2><a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
177</span>CHAPTER XII&mdash;ENGAGED TO BE MARRIED</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Was</span> the &ldquo;poor Peter&rdquo; of
Cranford the Aga Jenkyns of Chunderabaddad, or was he not?&nbsp;
As somebody says, that was the question.</p>
<p>In my own home, whenever people had nothing else to do, they
blamed me for want of discretion.&nbsp; Indiscretion was my
bug-bear fault.&nbsp; Everybody has a bug-bear fault, a sort of
standing characteristic&mdash;a <i>pi&egrave;ce de
r&eacute;sistance</i> for their friends to cut at; and in general
they cut and come again.&nbsp; I was tired of being called
indiscreet and incautious; and I determined for once to prove
myself a model of prudence and wisdom.&nbsp; I would not even
hint my suspicions respecting the Aga.&nbsp; I would collect
evidence and carry it home to lay before my father, as the family
friend of the two Miss Jenkynses.</p>
<p>In my search after facts, I was often reminded of a
description my father had once given of a ladies&rsquo; committee
that he had had to preside over.&nbsp; He said he could not help
thinking of a passage in Dickens, which spoke of a chorus in
which every man took the tune he knew best, and sang it to his
own satisfaction.&nbsp; So, at this charitable committee, every
lady took the subject uppermost in her mind, and talked <a
name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>about it to
her own great contentment, but not much to the advancement of the
subject they had met to discuss.&nbsp; But even that committee
could have been nothing to the Cranford ladies when I attempted
to gain some clear and definite information as to poor
Peter&rsquo;s height, appearance, and when and where he was seen
and heard of last.&nbsp; For instance, I remember asking Miss
Pole (and I thought the question was very opportune, for I put it
when I met her at a call at Mrs Forrester&rsquo;s, and both the
ladies had known Peter, and I imagined that they might refresh
each other&rsquo;s memories)&mdash;I asked Miss Pole what was the
very last thing they had ever heard about him; and then she named
the absurd report to which I have alluded, about his having been
elected Great Lama of Thibet; and this was a signal for each lady
to go off on her separate idea.&nbsp; Mrs Forrester&rsquo;s start
was made on the veiled prophet in Lalla Rookh&mdash;whether I
thought he was meant for the Great Lama, though Peter was not so
ugly, indeed rather handsome, if he had not been freckled.&nbsp;
I was thankful to see her double upon Peter; but, in a moment,
the delusive lady was off upon Rowland&rsquo;s Kalydor, and the
merits of cosmetics and hair oils in general, and holding forth
so fluently that I turned to listen to Miss Pole, who (through
the llamas, the beasts of burden) had got to Peruvian bonds, and
the share market, and her poor opinion of joint-stock banks in
general, and of that one in particular in which Miss
Matty&rsquo;s money was invested.&nbsp; In vain I put in
&ldquo;When was it&mdash;in what year was it that you heard that
Mr Peter was the Great Lama?&rdquo;&nbsp; They only joined issue
to dispute whether llamas <a name="page179"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 179</span>were carnivorous animals or not; in
which dispute they were not quite on fair grounds, as Mrs
Forrester (after they had grown warm and cool again) acknowledged
that she always confused carnivorous and graminivorous together,
just as she did horizontal and perpendicular; but then she
apologised for it very prettily, by saying that in her day the
only use people made of four-syllabled words was to teach how
they should be spelt.</p>
<p>The only fact I gained from this conversation was that
certainly Peter had last been heard of in India, &ldquo;or that
neighbourhood&rdquo;; and that this scanty intelligence of his
whereabouts had reached Cranford in the year when Miss Pole had
brought her Indian muslin gown, long since worn out (we washed it
and mended it, and traced its decline and fall into a
window-blind before we could go on); and in a year when Wombwell
came to Cranford, because Miss Matty had wanted to see an
elephant in order that she might the better imagine Peter riding
on one; and had seen a boa-constrictor too, which was more than
she wished to imagine in her fancy-pictures of Peter&rsquo;s
locality; and in a year when Miss Jenkyns had learnt some piece
of poetry off by heart, and used to say, at all the Cranford
parties, how Peter was &ldquo;surveying mankind from China to
Peru,&rdquo; which everybody had thought very grand, and rather
appropriate, because India was between China and Peru, if you
took care to turn the globe to the left instead of the right.</p>
<p>I suppose all these inquiries of mine, and the consequent
curiosity excited in the minds of my <a name="page180"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 180</span>friends, made us blind and deaf to
what was going on around us.&nbsp; It seemed to me as if the sun
rose and shone, and as if the rain rained on Cranford, just as
usual, and I did not notice any sign of the times that could be
considered as a prognostic of any uncommon event; and, to the
best of my belief, not only Miss Matty and Mrs Forrester, but
even Miss Pole herself, whom we looked upon as a kind of
prophetess, from the knack she had of foreseeing things before
they came to pass&mdash;although she did not like to disturb her
friends by telling them her foreknowledge&mdash;even Miss Pole
herself was breathless with astonishment when she came to tell us
of the astounding piece of news.&nbsp; But I must recover myself;
the contemplation of it, even at this distance of time, has taken
away my breath and my grammar, and unless I subdue my emotion, my
spelling will go too.</p>
<p>We were sitting&mdash;Miss Matty and I&mdash;much as usual,
she in the blue chintz easy-chair, with her back to the light,
and her knitting in her hand, I reading aloud the <i>St
James&rsquo;s Chronicle</i>.&nbsp; A few minutes more, and we
should have gone to make the little alterations in dress usual
before calling-time (twelve o&rsquo;clock) in Cranford.&nbsp; I
remember the scene and the date well.&nbsp; We had been talking
of the signor&rsquo;s rapid recovery since the warmer weather had
set in, and praising Mr Hoggins&rsquo;s skill, and lamenting his
want of refinement and manner (it seems a curious coincidence
that this should have been our subject, but so it was), when a
knock was heard&mdash;a caller&rsquo;s knock&mdash;three distinct
taps&mdash;and we were flying (that is to say, Miss Matty could
not walk very fast, having <a name="page181"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 181</span>had a touch of rheumatism) to our
rooms, to change cap and collars, when Miss Pole arrested us by
calling out, as she came up the stairs, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
go&mdash;I can&rsquo;t wait&mdash;it is not twelve, I
know&mdash;but never mind your dress&mdash;I must speak to
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; We did our best to look as if it was not we who
had made the hurried movement, the sound of which she had heard;
for, of course, we did not like to have it supposed that we had
any old clothes that it was convenient to wear out in the
&ldquo;sanctuary of home,&rdquo; as Miss Jenkyns once prettily
called the back parlour, where she was tying up preserves.&nbsp;
So we threw our gentility with double force into our manners, and
very genteel we were for two minutes while Miss Pole recovered
breath, and excited our curiosity strongly by lifting up her
hands in amazement, and bringing them down in silence, as if what
she had to say was too big for words, and could only be expressed
by pantomime.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think, Miss Matty?&nbsp; What <i>do</i> you
think?&nbsp; Lady Glenmire is to marry&mdash;is to be married, I
mean&mdash;Lady Glenmire&mdash;Mr Hoggins&mdash;Mr Hoggins is
going to marry Lady Glenmire!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marry!&rdquo; said we.&nbsp; &ldquo;Marry!&nbsp;
Madness!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p179b.jpg">
<img alt=
"What do you think, Miss Matty"

"What do you think, Miss Matty"
src="images/p179s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Marry!&rdquo; said Miss Pole, with the decision that
belonged to her character.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>I</i> said marry! as
you do; and I also said, &lsquo;What a fool my lady is going to
make of herself!&rsquo;&nbsp; I could have said
&lsquo;Madness!&rsquo; but I controlled myself, for it was in a
public shop that I heard of it.&nbsp; Where feminine delicacy is
gone to, I don&rsquo;t know!&nbsp; You and I, Miss Matty, would
have been ashamed to have known that our marriage was spoken of
in a grocer&rsquo;s shop, in the hearing of shopmen!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
182</span>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Miss Matty, sighing as one
recovering from a blow, &ldquo;perhaps it is not true.&nbsp;
Perhaps we are doing her injustice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Miss Pole.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have taken
care to ascertain that.&nbsp; I went straight to Mrs Fitz-Adam,
to borrow a cookery-book which I knew she had; and I introduced
my congratulations <i>&agrave; propos</i> of the difficulty
gentlemen must have in house-keeping; and Mrs Fitz-Adam bridled
up, and said that she believed it was true, though how and where
I could have heard it she did not know.&nbsp; She said her
brother and Lady Glenmire had come to an understanding at
last.&nbsp; &lsquo;Understanding!&rsquo; such a coarse
word!&nbsp; But my lady will have to come down to many a want of
refinement.&nbsp; I have reason to believe Mr Hoggins sups on
bread-and-cheese and beer every night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marry!&rdquo; said Miss Matty once again.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well!&nbsp; I never thought of it.&nbsp; Two people that
we know going to be married.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s coming very
near!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So near that my heart stopped beating when I heard of
it, while you might have counted twelve,&rdquo; said Miss
Pole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One does not know whose turn may come next.&nbsp; Here,
in Cranford, poor Lady Glenmire might have thought herself
safe,&rdquo; said Miss Matty, with a gentle pity in her
tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; said Miss Pole, with a toss of her
head.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember poor dear Captain
Brown&rsquo;s song &lsquo;Tibbie Fowler,&rsquo; and the
line&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Set her on the Tintock tap,<br />
The wind will blaw a man till her.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
183</span>&ldquo;That was because &lsquo;Tibbie Fowler&rsquo; was
rich, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well! there was a kind of attraction about Lady
Glenmire that I, for one, should be ashamed to have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I put in my wonder.&nbsp; &ldquo;But how can she have fancied
Mr Hoggins?&nbsp; I am not surprised that Mr Hoggins has liked
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; Mr Hoggins is rich,
and very pleasant-looking,&rdquo; said Miss Matty, &ldquo;and
very good-tempered and kind-hearted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has married for an establishment, that&rsquo;s
it.&nbsp; I suppose she takes the surgery with it,&rdquo; said
Miss Pole, with a little dry laugh at her own joke.&nbsp; But,
like many people who think they have made a severe and sarcastic
speech, which yet is clever of its kind, she began to relax in
her grimness from the moment when she made this allusion to the
surgery; and we turned to speculate on the way in which Mrs
Jamieson would receive the news.&nbsp; The person whom she had
left in charge of her house to keep off followers from her maids
to set up a follower of her own!&nbsp; And that follower a man
whom Mrs Jamieson had tabooed as vulgar, and inadmissible to
Cranford society, not merely on account of his name, but because
of his voice, his complexion, his boots, smelling of the stable,
and himself, smelling of drugs.&nbsp; Had he ever been to see
Lady Glenmire at Mrs Jamieson&rsquo;s?&nbsp; Chloride of lime
would not purify the house in its owner&rsquo;s estimation if he
had.&nbsp; Or had their interviews been confined to the
occasional meetings in the chamber of the poor sick conjuror, to
whom, with all our sense of the <i>m&eacute;salliance</i>, we
could <a name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
184</span>not help allowing that they had both been exceedingly
kind?&nbsp; And now it turned out that a servant of Mrs
Jamieson&rsquo;s had been ill, and Mr Hoggins had been attending
her for some weeks.&nbsp; So the wolf had got into the fold, and
now he was carrying off the shepherdess.&nbsp; What would Mrs
Jamieson say?&nbsp; We looked into the darkness of futurity as a
child gazes after a rocket up in the cloudy sky, full of
wondering expectation of the rattle, the discharge, and the
brilliant shower of sparks and light.&nbsp; Then we brought
ourselves down to earth and the present time by questioning each
other (being all equally ignorant, and all equally without the
slightest data to build any conclusions upon) as to when <span
class="GutSmall">IT</span> would take place?&nbsp; Where?&nbsp;
How much a year Mr Hoggins had?&nbsp; Whether she would drop her
title?&nbsp; And how Martha and the other correct servants in
Cranford would ever be brought to announce a married couple as
Lady Glenmire and Mr Hoggins?&nbsp; But would they be
visited?&nbsp; Would Mrs Jamieson let us?&nbsp; Or must we choose
between the Honourable Mrs Jamieson and the degraded Lady
Glenmire?&nbsp; We all liked Lady Glenmire the best.&nbsp; She
was bright, and kind, and sociable, and agreeable; and Mrs
Jamieson was dull, and inert, and pompous, and tiresome.&nbsp;
But we had acknowledged the sway of the latter so long, that it
seemed like a kind of disloyalty now even to meditate
disobedience to the prohibition we anticipated.</p>
<p>Mrs Forrester surprised us in our darned caps and patched
collars; and we forgot all about them in our eagerness to see how
she would bear the information, which we honourably left to Miss
Pole, to <a name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
185</span>impart, although, if we had been inclined to take
unfair advantage, we might have rushed in ourselves, for she had
a most out-of-place fit of coughing for five minutes after Mrs
Forrester entered the room.&nbsp; I shall never forget the
imploring expression of her eyes, as she looked at us over her
pocket-handkerchief.&nbsp; They said, as plain as words could
speak, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let Nature deprive me of the treasure
which is mine, although for a time I can make no use of
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; And we did not.</p>
<p>Mrs Forrester&rsquo;s surprise was equal to ours; and her
sense of injury rather greater, because she had to feel for her
Order, and saw more fully than we could do how such conduct
brought stains on the aristocracy.</p>
<p>When she and Miss Pole left us we endeavoured to subside into
calmness; but Miss Matty was really upset by the intelligence she
had heard.&nbsp; She reckoned it up, and it was more than fifteen
years since she had heard of any of her acquaintance going to be
married, with the one exception of Miss Jessie Brown; and, as she
said, it gave her quite a shock, and made her feel as if she
could not think what would happen next.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know whether it is a fancy of mine, or a real
fact, but I have noticed that, just after the announcement of an
engagement in any set, the unmarried ladies in that set flutter
out in an unusual gaiety and newness of dress, as much as to say,
in a tacit and unconscious manner, &ldquo;We also are
spinsters.&rdquo;&nbsp; Miss Matty and Miss Pole talked and
thought more about bonnets, gowns, caps, and shawls, during the
fortnight that succeeded this call, <a name="page186"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 186</span>than I had known them do for years
before.&nbsp; But it might be the spring weather, for it was a
warm and pleasant March; and merinoes and beavers, and woollen
materials of all sorts were but ungracious receptacles of the
bright sun&rsquo;s glancing rays.&nbsp; It had not been Lady
Glenmire&rsquo;s dress that had won Mr Hoggins&rsquo;s heart, for
she went about on her errands of kindness more shabby than
ever.&nbsp; Although in the hurried glimpses I caught of her at
church or elsewhere she appeared rather to shun meeting any of
her friends, her face seemed to have almost something of the
flush of youth in it; her lips looked redder and more trembling
full than in their old compressed state, and her eyes dwelt on
all things with a lingering light, as if she was learning to love
Cranford and its belongings.&nbsp; Mr Hoggins looked broad and
radiant, and creaked up the middle aisle at church in a brand-new
pair of top-boots&mdash;an audible, as well as visible, sign of
his purposed change of state; for the tradition went, that the
boots he had worn till now were the identical pair in which he
first set out on his rounds in Cranford twenty-five years ago;
only they had been new-pieced, high and low, top and bottom, heel
and sole, black leather and brown leather, more times than any
one could tell.</p>
<p>None of the ladies in Cranford chose to sanction the marriage
by congratulating either of the parties.&nbsp; We wished to
ignore the whole affair until our liege lady, Mrs Jamieson,
returned.&nbsp; Till she came back to give us our cue, we felt
that it would be better to consider the engagement in the same
light as the Queen of Spain&rsquo;s legs&mdash;facts which
certainly existed, but the less said about the better.&nbsp; This
restraint <a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
187</span>upon our tongues&mdash;for you see if we did not speak
about it to any of the parties concerned, how could we get
answers to the questions that we longed to ask?&mdash;was
beginning to be irksome, and our idea of the dignity of silence
was paling before our curiosity, when another direction was given
to our thoughts, by an announcement on the part of the principal
shopkeeper of Cranford, who ranged the trades from grocer and
cheesemonger to man-milliner, as occasion required, that the
spring fashions were arrived, and would be exhibited on the
following Tuesday at his rooms in High Street.&nbsp; Now Miss
Matty had been only waiting for this before buying herself a new
silk gown.&nbsp; I had offered, it is true, to send to Drumble
for patterns, but she had rejected my proposal, gently implying
that she had not forgotten her disappointment about the sea-green
turban.&nbsp; I was thankful that I was on the spot now, to
counteract the dazzling fascination of any yellow or scarlet
silk.</p>
<p>I must say a word or two here about myself.&nbsp; I have
spoken of my father&rsquo;s old friendship for the Jenkyns
family; indeed, I am not sure if there was not some distant
relationship.&nbsp; He had willingly allowed me to remain all the
winter at Cranford, in consideration of a letter which Miss Matty
had written to him about the time of the panic, in which I
suspect she had exaggerated my powers and my bravery as a
defender of the house.&nbsp; But now that the days were longer
and more cheerful, he was beginning to urge the necessity of my
return; and I only delayed in a sort of odd forlorn hope that if
I could obtain any clear information, I might <a
name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>make the
account given by the signora of the Aga Jenkyns tally with that
of &ldquo;poor Peter,&rdquo; his appearance and disappearance,
which I had winnowed out of the conversation of Miss Pole and Mrs
Forrester.</p>

189</span>CHAPTER XIII&mdash;STOPPED PAYMENT</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> very Tuesday morning on which
Mr Johnson was going to show the fashions, the post-woman brought
two letters to the house.&nbsp; I say the post-woman, but I
should say the postman&rsquo;s wife.&nbsp; He was a lame
shoemaker, a very clean, honest man, much respected in the town;
but he never brought the letters round except on unusual
occasions, such as Christmas Day or Good Friday; and on those
days the letters, which should have been delivered at eight in
the morning, did not make their appearance until two or three in
the afternoon, for every one liked poor Thomas, and gave him a
welcome on these festive occasions.&nbsp; He used to say,
&ldquo;He was welly stawed wi&rsquo; eating, for there were three
or four houses where nowt would serve &rsquo;em but he must share
in their breakfast;&rdquo; and by the time he had done his last
breakfast, he came to some other friend who was beginning dinner;
but come what might in the way of temptation, Tom was always
sober, civil, and smiling; and, as Miss Jenkyns used to say, it
was a lesson in patience, that she doubted not would call out
that precious quality in some <a name="page190"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 190</span>minds, where, but for Thomas, it
might have lain dormant and undiscovered.&nbsp; Patience was
certainly very dormant in Miss Jenkyns&rsquo;s mind.&nbsp; She
was always expecting letters, and always drumming on the table
till the post-woman had called or gone past.&nbsp; On Christmas
Day and Good Friday she drummed from breakfast till church, from
church-time till two o&rsquo;clock&mdash;unless when the fire
wanted stirring, when she invariably knocked down the fire-irons,
and scolded Miss Matty for it.&nbsp; But equally certain was the
hearty welcome and the good dinner for Thomas; Miss Jenkyns
standing over him like a bold dragoon, questioning him as to his
children&mdash;what they were doing&mdash;what school they went
to; upbraiding him if another was likely to make its appearance,
but sending even the little babies the shilling and the mince-pie
which was her gift to all the children, with half-a-crown in
addition for both father and mother.&nbsp; The post was not half
of so much consequence to dear Miss Matty; but not for the world
would she have diminished Thomas&rsquo;s welcome and his dole,
though I could see that she felt rather shy over the ceremony,
which had been regarded by Miss Jenkyns as a glorious opportunity
for giving advice and benefiting her fellow-creatures.&nbsp; Miss
Matty would steal the money all in a lump into his hand, as if
she were ashamed of herself.&nbsp; Miss Jenkyns gave him each
individual coin separate, with a &ldquo;There! that&rsquo;s for
yourself; that&rsquo;s for Jenny,&rdquo; etc.&nbsp; Miss Matty
would even beckon Martha out of the kitchen while he ate his
food: and once, to my knowledge, winked at its rapid
disappearance into a blue cotton pocket-handkerchief.&nbsp; Miss
Jenkyns almost scolded him if he <a name="page191"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 191</span>did not leave a clean plate, however
heaped it might have been, and gave an injunction with every
mouthful.</p>

</a></p>
<p>I have wandered a long way from the two letters that awaited
us on the breakfast-table that Tuesday morning.&nbsp; Mine was
from my father.&nbsp; Miss Matty&rsquo;s was printed.&nbsp; My
father&rsquo;s was just a man&rsquo;s letter; I mean it was very
dull, and gave no information beyond that he was well, that they
had had a good deal of rain, that trade was very stagnant, and
there were many disagreeable rumours afloat.&nbsp; He then asked
me if I knew whether Miss Matty still retained her shares in the
Town and County Bank, as there were very unpleasant reports about
it; though nothing more than he had always foreseen, and had
prophesied to Miss Jenkyns years ago, when she would invest their
little property in it&mdash;the only unwise step that clever
woman had ever taken, to his knowledge (the only time she ever
acted against his advice, I knew).&nbsp; However, if anything had
gone wrong, of course I was not to think of leaving Miss Matty
while I could be of any use, etc.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is your letter from, my dear?&nbsp; Mine is a very
civil invitation, signed &lsquo;Edwin Wilson,&rsquo; asking me to
attend an important meeting of the shareholders of the Town and
County Bank, to be held in Drumble, on Thursday the
twenty-first.&nbsp; I am sure, it is very attentive of them to
remember me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did not like to hear of this &ldquo;important
meeting,&rdquo; for, though I did not know much about business, I
feared it confirmed what my father said: however, I thought, ill
news always came fast enough, so I resolved to say nothing about
my alarm, and merely <a name="page192"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 192</span>told her that my father was well,
and sent his kind regards to her.&nbsp; She kept turning over and
admiring her letter.&nbsp; At last she spoke&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember their sending one to Deborah just like this;
but that I did not wonder at, for everybody knew she was so
clear-headed.&nbsp; I am afraid I could not help them much;
indeed, if they came to accounts, I should be quite in the way,
for I never could do sums in my head.&nbsp; Deborah, I know,
rather wished to go, and went so far as to order a new bonnet for
the occasion: but when the time came she had a bad cold; so they
sent her a very polite account of what they had done.&nbsp;
Chosen a director, I think it was.&nbsp; Do you think they want
me to help them to choose a director?&nbsp; I am sure I should
choose your father at once!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father has no shares in the bank,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&nbsp; I remember.&nbsp; He objected very much
to Deborah&rsquo;s buying any, I believe.&nbsp; But she was quite
the woman of business, and always judged for herself; and here,
you see, they have paid eight per cent. all these
years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a very uncomfortable subject to me, with my
half-knowledge; so I thought I would change the conversation, and
I asked at what time she thought we had better go and see the
fashions.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, my dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the
thing is this: it is not etiquette to go till after twelve; but
then, you see, all Cranford will be there, and one does not like
to be too curious about dress and trimmings and caps with all the
world looking on.&nbsp; It is never genteel to be over-curious on
these occasions.&nbsp; Deborah had the knack of always looking as
if the latest fashion was <a name="page193"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 193</span>nothing new to her; a manner she had
caught from Lady Arley, who did see all the new modes in London,
you know.&nbsp; So I thought we would just slip down&mdash;for I
do want this morning, soon after breakfast half-a-pound of
tea&mdash;and then we could go up and examine the things at our
leisure, and see exactly how my new silk gown must be made; and
then, after twelve, we could go with our minds disengaged, and
free from thoughts of dress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We began to talk of Miss Matty&rsquo;s new silk gown.&nbsp; I
discovered that it would be really the first time in her life
that she had had to choose anything of consequence for herself:
for Miss Jenkyns had always been the more decided character,
whatever her taste might have been; and it is astonishing how
such people carry the world before them by the mere force of
will.&nbsp; Miss Matty anticipated the sight of the glossy folds
with as much delight as if the five sovereigns, set apart for the
purchase, could buy all the silks in the shop; and (remembering
my own loss of two hours in a toyshop before I could tell on what
wonder to spend a silver threepence) I was very glad that we were
going early, that dear Miss Matty might have leisure for the
delights of perplexity.</p>
<p>If a happy sea-green could be met with, the gown was to be
sea-green: if not, she inclined to maize, and I to silver gray;
and we discussed the requisite number of breadths until we
arrived at the shop-door.&nbsp; We were to buy the tea, select
the silk, and then clamber up the iron corkscrew stairs that led
into what was once a loft, though now a fashion show-room.</p>
<p>The young men at Mr Johnson&rsquo;s had on their <a
name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 194</span>best looks;
and their best cravats, and pivoted themselves over the counter
with surprising activity.&nbsp; They wanted to show us upstairs
at once; but on the principle of business first and pleasure
afterwards, we stayed to purchase the tea.&nbsp; Here Miss
Matty&rsquo;s absence of mind betrayed itself.&nbsp; If she was
made aware that she had been drinking green tea at any time, she
always thought it her duty to lie awake half through the night
afterward (I have known her take it in ignorance many a time
without such effects), and consequently green tea was prohibited
the house; yet to-day she herself asked for the obnoxious
article, under the impression that she was talking about the
silk.&nbsp; However, the mistake was soon rectified; and then the
silks were unrolled in good truth.&nbsp; By this time the shop
was pretty well filled, for it was Cranford market-day, and many
of the farmers and country people from the neighbourhood round
came in, sleeking down their hair, and glancing shyly about, from
under their eyelids, as anxious to take back some notion of the
unusual gaiety to the mistress or the lasses at home, and yet
feeling that they were out of place among the smart shopmen and
gay shawls and summer prints.&nbsp; One honest-looking man,
however, made his way up to the counter at which we stood, and
boldly asked to look at a shawl or two.&nbsp; The other country
folk confined themselves to the grocery side; but our neighbour
was evidently too full of some kind intention towards mistress,
wife or daughter, to be shy; and it soon became a question with
me, whether he or Miss Matty would keep their shopmen the longest
time.&nbsp; He thought each shawl more beautiful than the last;
and, as for Miss <a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
195</span>Matty, she smiled and sighed over each fresh bale that
was brought out; one colour set off another, and the heap
together would, as she said, make even the rainbow look poor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; said she, hesitating,
&ldquo;Whichever I choose I shall wish I had taken another.&nbsp;
Look at this lovely crimson! it would be so warm in winter.&nbsp;
But spring is coming on, you know.&nbsp; I wish I could have a
gown for every season,&rdquo; said she, dropping her
voice&mdash;as we all did in Cranford whenever we talked of
anything we wished for but could not afford.&nbsp;
&ldquo;However,&rdquo; she continued in a louder and more
cheerful tone, &ldquo;it would give me a great deal of trouble to
take care of them if I had them; so, I think, I&rsquo;ll only
take one.&nbsp; But which must it be, my dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now she hovered over a lilac with yellow spots, while I
pulled out a quiet sage-green that had faded into insignificance
under the more brilliant colours, but which was nevertheless a
good silk in its humble way.&nbsp; Our attention was called off
to our neighbour.&nbsp; He had chosen a shawl of about thirty
shillings&rsquo; value; and his face looked broadly happy, under
the anticipation, no doubt, of the pleasant surprise he would
give to some Molly or Jenny at home; he had tugged a leathern
purse out of his breeches-pocket, and had offered a five-pound
note in payment for the shawl, and for some parcels which had
been brought round to him from the grocery counter; and it was
just at this point that he attracted our notice.&nbsp; The
shopman was examining the note with a puzzled, doubtful air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Town and County Bank!&nbsp; I am not sure, <a
name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 196</span>sir, but I
believe we have received a warning against notes issued by this
bank only this morning.&nbsp; I will just step and ask Mr
Johnson, sir; but I&rsquo;m afraid I must trouble you for payment
in cash, or in a note of a different bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I never saw a man&rsquo;s countenance fall so suddenly into
dismay and bewilderment.&nbsp; It was almost piteous to see the
rapid change.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dang it!&rdquo; said he, striking his fist down on the
table, as if to try which was the harder, &ldquo;the chap talks
as if notes and gold were to be had for the picking
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Matty had forgotten her silk gown in her interest for the
man.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think she had caught the name of the
bank, and in my nervous cowardice I was anxious that she should
not; and so I began admiring the yellow-spotted lilac gown that I
had been utterly condemning only a minute before.&nbsp; But it
was of no use.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What bank was it?&nbsp; I mean, what bank did your note
belong to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Town and County Bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see it,&rdquo; said she quietly to the shopman,
gently taking it out of his hand, as he brought it back to return
it to the farmer.</p>
<p>Mr Johnson was very sorry, but, from information he had
received, the notes issued by that bank were little better than
waste paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand it,&rdquo; said Miss Matty to
me in a low voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;That is our bank, is it
not?&mdash;the Town and County Bank?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;This lilac silk will
just match the ribbons in your new cap, I believe,&rdquo; I
continued, <a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
197</span>holding up the folds so as to catch the light, and
wishing that the man would make haste and be gone, and yet having
a new wonder, that had only just sprung up, how far it was wise
or right in me to allow Miss Matty to make this expensive
purchase, if the affairs of the bank were really so bad as the
refusal of the note implied.</p>
<p>But Miss Matty put on the soft dignified manner, peculiar to
her, rarely used, and yet which became her so well, and laying
her hand gently on mine, she said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind the silks for a few minutes, dear.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t understand you, sir,&rdquo; turning now to the
shopman, who had been attending to the farmer.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is
this a forged note?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; It is a true note of its
kind; but you see, ma&rsquo;am, it is a joint-stock bank, and
there are reports out that it is likely to break.&nbsp; Mr
Johnson is only doing his duty, ma&rsquo;am, as I am sure Mr
Dobson knows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Mr Dobson could not respond to the appealing bow by any
answering smile.&nbsp; He was turning the note absently over in
his fingers, looking gloomily enough at the parcel containing the
lately-chosen shawl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard upon a poor man,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;as earns every farthing with the sweat of his brow.&nbsp;
However, there&rsquo;s no help for it.&nbsp; You must take back
your shawl, my man; Lizzle must go on with her cloak for a
while.&nbsp; And yon figs for the little ones&mdash;I promised
them to &rsquo;em&mdash;I&rsquo;ll take them; but the
&rsquo;bacco, and the other things&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will give you five sovereigns for your note, <a
name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 198</span>my good
man,&rdquo; said Miss Matty.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think there is some
great mistake about it, for I am one of the shareholders, and
I&rsquo;m sure they would have told me if things had not been
going on right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shopman whispered a word or two across the table to Miss
Matty.&nbsp; She looked at him with a dubious air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps so,&rdquo; said she.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I
don&rsquo;t pretend to understand business; I only know that if
it is going to fail, and if honest people are to lose their money
because they have taken our notes&mdash;I can&rsquo;t explain
myself,&rdquo; said she, suddenly becoming aware that she had got
into a long sentence with four people for audience; &ldquo;only I
would rather exchange my gold for the note, if you please,&rdquo;
turning to the farmer, &ldquo;and then you can take your wife the
shawl.&nbsp; It is only going without my gown a few days
longer,&rdquo; she continued, speaking to me.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then,
I have no doubt, everything will be cleared up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if it is cleared up the wrong way?&rdquo; said
I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, then it will only have been common honesty in me,
as a shareholder, to have given this good man the money.&nbsp; I
am quite clear about it in my own mind; but, you know, I can
never speak quite as comprehensibly as others can, only you must
give me your note, Mr Dobson, if you please, and go on with your
purchases with these sovereigns.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p198b.jpg">
<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>The man looked at her with silent gratitude&mdash;too awkward
to put his thanks into words; but he hung back for a minute or
two, fumbling with his note.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m loth to make another one lose instead of me,
if it is a loss; but, you see, five pounds is a <a
name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>deal of
money to a man with a family; and, as you say, ten to one in a
day or two the note will be as good as gold again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No hope of that, my friend,&rdquo; said the
shopman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The more reason why I should take it,&rdquo; said Miss
Matty quietly.&nbsp; She pushed her sovereigns towards the man,
who slowly laid his note down in exchange.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thank
you.&nbsp; I will wait a day or two before I purchase any of
these silks; perhaps you will then have a greater choice.&nbsp;
My dear, will you come upstairs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>We inspected the fashions with as minute and curious an
interest as if the gown to be made after them had been
bought.&nbsp; I could not see that the little event in the shop
below had in the least damped Miss Matty&rsquo;s curiosity as to
the make of sleeves or the sit of skirts.&nbsp; She once or twice
exchanged congratulations with me on our private and leisurely
view of the bonnets and shawls; but I was, all the time, not so
sure that our examination was so utterly private, for I caught
glimpses of a figure dodging behind the cloaks and mantles; and,
by a dexterous move, I came face to face with Miss Pole, also in
morning costume (the principal feature of which was her being
without teeth, and wearing a veil to conceal the deficiency),
come on the same errand as ourselves.&nbsp; But she quickly took
her departure, because, as she said, she had a bad headache, and
did not feel herself up to conversation.</p>
<p>As we came down through the shop, the civil Mr Johnson was
awaiting us; he had been informed of the exchange of the note for
gold, and with much <a name="page200"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 200</span>good feeling and real kindness, but
with a little want of tact, he wished to condole with Miss Matty,
and impress upon her the true state of the case.&nbsp; I could
only hope that he had heard an exaggerated rumour for he said
that her shares were worse than nothing, and that the bank could
not pay a shilling in the pound.&nbsp; I was glad that Miss Matty
seemed still a little incredulous; but I could not tell how much
of this was real or assumed, with that self-control which seemed
habitual to ladies of Miss Matty&rsquo;s standing in Cranford,
who would have thought their dignity compromised by the slightest
expression of surprise, dismay, or any similar feeling to an
inferior in station, or in a public shop.&nbsp; However, we
walked home very silently.&nbsp; I am ashamed to say, I believe I
was rather vexed and annoyed at Miss Matty&rsquo;s conduct in
taking the note to herself so decidedly.&nbsp; I had so set my
heart upon her having a new silk gown, which she wanted sadly; in
general she was so undecided anybody might turn her round; in
this case I had felt that it was no use attempting it, but I was
not the less put out at the result.</p>
<p>Somehow, after twelve o&rsquo;clock, we both acknowledged to a
sated curiosity about the fashions, and to a certain fatigue of
body (which was, in fact, depression of mind) that indisposed us
to go out again.&nbsp; But still we never spoke of the note;
till, all at once, something possessed me to ask Miss Matty if
she would think it her duty to offer sovereigns for all the notes
of the Town and County Bank she met with?&nbsp; I could have
bitten my tongue out the minute I had said it.&nbsp; She looked
up rather sadly, and as if I had thrown a new perplexity into her
already distressed <a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
201</span>mind; and for a minute or two she did not speak.&nbsp;
Then she said&mdash;my own dear Miss Matty&mdash;without a shade
of reproach in her voice&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear, I never feel as if my mind was what people
call very strong; and it&rsquo;s often hard enough work for me to
settle what I ought to do with the case right before me.&nbsp; I
was very thankful to&mdash;I was very thankful, that I saw my
duty this morning, with the poor man standing by me; but its
rather a strain upon me to keep thinking and thinking what I
should do if such and such a thing happened; and, I believe, I
had rather wait and see what really does come; and I don&rsquo;t
doubt I shall be helped then if I don&rsquo;t fidget myself, and
get too anxious beforehand.&nbsp; You know, love, I&rsquo;m not
like Deborah.&nbsp; If Deborah had lived, I&rsquo;ve no doubt she
would have seen after them, before they had got themselves into
this state.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We had neither of us much appetite for dinner, though we tried
to talk cheerfully about indifferent things.&nbsp; When we
returned into the drawing-room, Miss Matty unlocked her desk and
began to look over her account-books.&nbsp; I was so penitent for
what I had said in the morning, that I did not choose to take
upon myself the presumption to suppose that I could assist her; I
rather left her alone, as, with puzzled brow, her eye followed
her pen up and down the ruled page.&nbsp; By-and-by she shut the
book, locked the desk, and came and drew a chair to mine, where I
sat in moody sorrow over the fire.&nbsp; I stole my hand into
hers; she clasped it, but did not speak a word.&nbsp; At last she
said, with forced composure in her voice, &ldquo;If that bank
goes wrong, I shall lose one hundred and forty-nine pounds
thirteen shillings and fourpence <a name="page202"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 202</span>a year; I shall only have thirteen
pounds a year left.&rdquo;&nbsp; I squeezed her hand hard and
tight.&nbsp; I did not know what to say.&nbsp; Presently (it was
too dark to see her face) I felt her fingers work convulsively in
my grasp; and I knew she was going to speak again.&nbsp; I heard
the sobs in her voice as she said, &ldquo;I hope it&rsquo;s not
wrong&mdash;not wicked&mdash;but, oh!&nbsp; I am so glad poor
Deborah is spared this.&nbsp; She could not have borne to come
down in the world&mdash;she had such a noble, lofty
spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was all she said about the sister who had insisted upon
investing their little property in that unlucky bank.&nbsp; We
were later in lighting the candle than usual that night, and
until that light shamed us into speaking, we sat together very
silently and sadly.</p>
<p>However, we took to our work after tea with a kind of forced
cheerfulness (which soon became real as far as it went), talking
of that never-ending wonder, Lady Glenmire&rsquo;s
engagement.&nbsp; Miss Matty was almost coming round to think it
a good thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean to deny that men are troublesome in
a house.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t judge from my own experience, for my
father was neatness itself, and wiped his shoes on coming in as
carefully as any woman; but still a man has a sort of knowledge
of what should be done in difficulties, that it is very pleasant
to have one at hand ready to lean upon.&nbsp; Now, Lady Glenmire,
instead of being tossed about, and wondering where she is to
settle, will be certain of a home among pleasant and kind people,
such as our good Miss Pole and Mrs Forrester.&nbsp; And Mr
Hoggins is really a very personable man; and as for his manners,
why, if they are not very polished, I have known people with very
<a name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 203</span>good
hearts and very clever minds too, who were not what some people
reckoned refined, but who were both true and tender.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She fell off into a soft reverie about Mr Holbrook, and I did
not interrupt her, I was so busy maturing a plan I had had in my
mind for some days, but which this threatened failure of the bank
had brought to a crisis.&nbsp; That night, after Miss Matty went
to bed, I treacherously lighted the candle again, and sat down in
the drawing-room to compose a letter to the Aga Jenkyns, a letter
which should affect him if he were Peter, and yet seem a mere
statement of dry facts if he were a stranger.&nbsp; The church
clock pealed out two before I had done.</p>
<p>The next morning news came, both official and otherwise, that
the Town and County Bank had stopped payment.&nbsp; Miss Matty
was ruined.</p>
<p>She tried to speak quietly to me; but when she came to the
actual fact that she would have but about five shillings a week
to live upon, she could not restrain a few tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not crying for myself, dear,&rdquo; said she,
wiping them away; &ldquo;I believe I am crying for the very silly
thought of how my mother would grieve if she could know; she
always cared for us so much more than for herself.&nbsp; But many
a poor person has less, and I am not very extravagant, and, thank
God, when the neck of mutton, and Martha&rsquo;s wages, and the
rent are paid, I have not a farthing owing.&nbsp; Poor
Martha!&nbsp; I think she&rsquo;ll be sorry to leave
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Matty smiled at me through her tears, and she would fain
have had me see only the smile, not the tears.</p>

204</span>CHAPTER XIV&mdash;FRIENDS IN NEED</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was an example to me, and I
fancy it might be to many others, to see how immediately Miss
Matty set about the retrenchment which she knew to be right under
her altered circumstances.&nbsp; While she went down to speak to
Martha, and break the intelligence to her, I stole out with my
letter to the Aga Jenkyns, and went to the signor&rsquo;s
lodgings to obtain the exact address.&nbsp; I bound the signora
to secrecy; and indeed her military manners had a degree of
shortness and reserve in them which made her always say as little
as possible, except when under the pressure of strong
excitement.&nbsp; Moreover (which made my secret doubly sure),
the signor was now so far recovered as to be looking forward to
travelling and conjuring again in the space of a few days, when
he, his wife, and little Phoebe would leave Cranford.&nbsp;
Indeed, I found him looking over a great black and red placard,
in which the Signor Brunoni&rsquo;s accomplishments were set
forth, and to which only the name of the town where he would next
display them was wanting.&nbsp; He and his wife were so much
absorbed in deciding where the red <a name="page205"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 205</span>letters would come in with most
effect (it might have been the Rubric for that matter), that it
was some time before I could get my question asked privately, and
not before I had given several decisions, the which I questioned
afterwards with equal wisdom of sincerity as soon as the signor
threw in his doubts and reasons on the important subject.&nbsp;
At last I got the address, spelt by sound, and very queer it
looked.&nbsp; I dropped it in the post on my way home, and then
for a minute I stood looking at the wooden pane with a gaping
slit which divided me from the letter but a moment ago in my
hand.&nbsp; It was gone from me like life, never to be
recalled.&nbsp; It would get tossed about on the sea, and stained
with sea-waves perhaps, and be carried among palm-trees, and
scented with all tropical fragrance; the little piece of paper,
but an hour ago so familiar and commonplace, had set out on its
race to the strange wild countries beyond the Ganges!&nbsp; But I
could not afford to lose much time on this speculation.&nbsp; I
hastened home, that Miss Matty might not miss me.&nbsp; Martha
opened the door to me, her face swollen with crying.&nbsp; As
soon as she saw me she burst out afresh, and taking hold of my
arm she pulled me in, and banged the door to, in order to ask me
if indeed it was all true that Miss Matty had been saying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never leave her!&nbsp; No; I
won&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I telled her so, and said I could not think
how she could find in her heart to give me warning.&nbsp; I could
not have had the face to do it, if I&rsquo;d been her.&nbsp; I
might ha&rsquo; been just as good for nothing as Mrs
Fitz-Adam&rsquo;s Rosy, who struck for wages after living seven
years and a half in one place.&nbsp; I said I was not one to go
<a name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 206</span>and
serve Mammon at that rate; that I knew when I&rsquo;d got a good
missus, if she didn&rsquo;t know when she&rsquo;d got a good
servant&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Martha,&rdquo; said I, cutting in while she wiped
her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, &lsquo;but Martha&rsquo; me,&rdquo; she
replied to my deprecatory tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen to reason&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not listen to reason,&rdquo; she said, now
in full possession of her voice, which had been rather choked
with sobbing.&nbsp; &ldquo;Reason always means what someone else
has got to say.&nbsp; Now I think what I&rsquo;ve got to say is
good enough reason; but reason or not, I&rsquo;ll say it, and
I&rsquo;ll stick to it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve money in the Savings
Bank, and I&rsquo;ve a good stock of clothes, and I&rsquo;m not
going to leave Miss Matty.&nbsp; No, not if she gives me warning
every hour in the day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She put her arms akimbo, as much as to say she defied me; and,
indeed, I could hardly tell how to begin to remonstrate with her,
so much did I feel that Miss Matty, in her increasing infirmity,
needed the attendance of this kind and faithful woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&rdquo;&mdash;said I at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m thankful you begin with
&lsquo;well!&rsquo;&nbsp; If you&rsquo;d have begun with
&lsquo;but,&rsquo; as you did afore, I&rsquo;d not ha&rsquo;
listened to you.&nbsp; Now you may go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you would be a great loss to Miss Matty,
Martha&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I telled her so.&nbsp; A loss she&rsquo;d never cease
to be sorry for,&rdquo; broke in Martha triumphantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still, she will have so little&mdash;so very
little&mdash;to live upon, that I don&rsquo;t see just now how
she could find you food&mdash;she will even be pressed for her
own.&nbsp; <a name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
207</span>I tell you this, Martha, because I feel you are like a
friend to dear Miss Matty, but you know she might not like to
have it spoken about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Apparently this was even a blacker view of the subject than
Miss Matty had presented to her, for Martha just sat down on the
first chair that came to hand, and cried out loud (we had been
standing in the kitchen).</p>
<p>At last she put her apron down, and looking me earnestly in
the face, asked, &ldquo;Was that the reason Miss Matty
wouldn&rsquo;t order a pudding to-day?&nbsp; She said she had no
great fancy for sweet things, and you and she would just have a
mutton chop.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ll be up to her.&nbsp; Never you
tell, but I&rsquo;ll make her a pudding, and a pudding
she&rsquo;ll like, too, and I&rsquo;ll pay for it myself; so mind
you see she eats it.&nbsp; Many a one has been comforted in their
sorrow by seeing a good dish come upon the table.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was rather glad that Martha&rsquo;s energy had taken the
immediate and practical direction of pudding-making, for it
staved off the quarrelsome discussion as to whether she should or
should not leave Miss Matty&rsquo;s service.&nbsp; She began to
tie on a clean apron, and otherwise prepare herself for going to
the shop for the butter, eggs, and what else she might
require.&nbsp; She would not use a scrap of the articles already
in the house for her cookery, but went to an old tea-pot in which
her private store of money was deposited, and took out what she
wanted.</p>
<p>I found Miss Matty very quiet, and not a little sad; but
by-and-by she tried to smile for my sake.&nbsp; It was settled
that I was to write to my father, and ask him to come over and
hold a consultation, and as <a name="page208"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 208</span>soon as this letter was despatched
we began to talk over future plans.&nbsp; Miss Matty&rsquo;s idea
was to take a single room, and retain as much of her furniture as
would be necessary to fit up this, and sell the rest, and there
to quietly exist upon what would remain after paying the
rent.&nbsp; For my part, I was more ambitious and less
contented.&nbsp; I thought of all the things by which a woman,
past middle age, and with the education common to ladies fifty
years ago, could earn or add to a living without materially
losing caste; but at length I put even this last clause on one
side, and wondered what in the world Miss Matty could do.</p>
<p>Teaching was, of course, the first thing that suggested
itself.&nbsp; If Miss Matty could teach children anything, it
would throw her among the little elves in whom her soul
delighted.&nbsp; I ran over her accomplishments.&nbsp; Once upon
a time I had heard her say she could play &ldquo;Ah! vous
dirai-je, maman?&rdquo; on the piano, but that was long, long
ago; that faint shadow of musical acquirement had died out years
before.&nbsp; She had also once been able to trace out patterns
very nicely for muslin embroidery, by dint of placing a piece of
silver paper over the design to be copied, and holding both
against the window-pane while she marked the scollop and
eyelet-holes.&nbsp; But that was her nearest approach to the
accomplishment of drawing, and I did not think it would go very
far.&nbsp; Then again, as to the branches of a solid English
education&mdash;fancy work and the use of the globes&mdash;such
as the mistress of the Ladies&rsquo; Seminary, to which all the
tradespeople in Cranford sent their daughters, professed to
teach.&nbsp; Miss Matty&rsquo;s eyes <a name="page209"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 209</span>were failing her, and I doubted if
she could discover the number of threads in a worsted-work
pattern, or rightly appreciate the different shades required for
Queen Adelaide&rsquo;s face in the loyal wool-work now
fashionable in Cranford.&nbsp; As for the use of the globes, I
had never been able to find it out myself, so perhaps I was not a
good judge of Miss Matty&rsquo;s capability of instructing in
this branch of education; but it struck me that equators and
tropics, and such mystical circles, were very imaginary lines
indeed to her, and that she looked upon the signs of the Zodiac
as so many remnants of the Black Art.</p>
<p>What she piqued herself upon, as arts in which she excelled,
was making candle-lighters, or &ldquo;spills&rdquo; (as she
preferred calling them), of coloured paper, cut so as to resemble
feathers, and knitting garters in a variety of dainty
stitches.&nbsp; I had once said, on receiving a present of an
elaborate pair, that I should feel quite tempted to drop one of
them in the street, in order to have it admired; but I found this
little joke (and it was a very little one) was such a distress to
her sense of propriety, and was taken with such anxious, earnest
alarm, lest the temptation might some day prove too strong for
me, that I quite regretted having ventured upon it.&nbsp; A
present of these delicately-wrought garters, a bunch of gay
&ldquo;spills,&rdquo; or a set of cards on which sewing-silk was
wound in a mystical manner, were the well-known tokens of Miss
Matty&rsquo;s favour.&nbsp; But would any one pay to have their
children taught these arts? or, indeed, would Miss Matty sell,
for filthy lucre, the knack and the skill with which she made
trifles of value to those who loved her?</p>
<p><a name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 210</span>I had
to come down to reading, writing, and arithmetic; and, in reading
the chapter every morning, she always coughed before coming to
long words.&nbsp; I doubted her power of getting through a
genealogical chapter, with any number of coughs.&nbsp; Writing
she did well and delicately&mdash;but spelling!&nbsp; She seemed
to think that the more out-of-the-way this was, and the more
trouble it cost her, the greater the compliment she paid to her
correspondent; and words that she would spell quite correctly in
her letters to me became perfect enigmas when she wrote to my
father.</p>
<p>No! there was nothing she could teach to the rising generation
of Cranford, unless they had been quick learners and ready
imitators of her patience, her humility, her sweetness, her quiet
contentment with all that she could not do.&nbsp; I pondered and
pondered until dinner was announced by Martha, with a face all
blubbered and swollen with crying.</p>
<p>Miss Matty had a few little peculiarities which Martha was apt
to regard as whims below her attention, and appeared to consider
as childish fancies of which an old lady of fifty-eight should
try and cure herself.&nbsp; But to-day everything was attended to
with the most careful regard.&nbsp; The bread was cut to the
imaginary pattern of excellence that existed in Miss
Matty&rsquo;s mind, as being the way which her mother had
preferred, the curtain was drawn so as to exclude the dead brick
wall of a neighbour&rsquo;s stable, and yet left so as to show
every tender leaf of the poplar which was bursting into spring
beauty.&nbsp; Martha&rsquo;s tone to Miss Matty was just such as
that good, rough-spoken servant usually kept sacred for <a
name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 211</span>little
children, and which I had never heard her use to any grown-up
person.</p>
<p>I had forgotten to tell Miss Matty about the pudding, and I
was afraid she might not do justice to it, for she had evidently
very little appetite this day; so I seized the opportunity of
letting her into the secret while Martha took away the
meat.&nbsp; Miss Matty&rsquo;s eyes filled with tears, and she
could not speak, either to express surprise or delight, when
Martha returned bearing it aloft, made in the most wonderful
representation of a lion <i>couchant</i> that ever was
moulded.&nbsp; Martha&rsquo;s face gleamed with triumph as she
set it down before Miss Matty with an exultant
&ldquo;There!&rdquo;&nbsp; Miss Matty wanted to speak her thanks,
but could not; so she took Martha&rsquo;s hand and shook it
warmly, which set Martha off crying, and I myself could hardly
keep up the necessary composure.&nbsp; Martha burst out of the
room, and Miss Matty had to clear her voice once or twice before
she could speak.&nbsp; At last she said, &ldquo;I should like to
keep this pudding under a glass shade, my dear!&rdquo; and the
notion of the lion <i>couchant</i>, with his currant eyes, being
hoisted up to the place of honour on a mantelpiece, tickled my
hysterical fancy, and I began to laugh, which rather surprised
Miss Matty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure, dear, I have seen uglier things under a
glass shade before now,&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>So had I, many a time and oft, and I accordingly composed my
countenance (and now I could hardly keep from crying), and we
both fell to upon the pudding, which was indeed
excellent&mdash;only every morsel seemed to choke us, our hearts
were so full.</p>
<p>We had too much to think about to talk much <a
name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 212</span>that
afternoon.&nbsp; It passed over very tranquilly.&nbsp; But when
the tea-urn was brought in a new thought came into my head.&nbsp;
Why should not Miss Matty sell tea&mdash;be an agent to the East
India Tea Company which then existed?&nbsp; I could see no
objections to this plan, while the advantages were
many&mdash;always supposing that Miss Matty could get over the
degradation of condescending to anything like trade.&nbsp; Tea
was neither greasy nor sticky&mdash;grease and stickiness being
two of the qualities which Miss Matty could not endure.&nbsp; No
shop-window would be required.&nbsp; A small, genteel
notification of her being licensed to sell tea would, it is true,
be necessary, but I hoped that it could be placed where no one
would see it.&nbsp; Neither was tea a heavy article, so as to tax
Miss Matty&rsquo;s fragile strength.&nbsp; The only thing against
my plan was the buying and selling involved.</p>
<p>While I was giving but absent answers to the questions Miss
Matty was putting&mdash;almost as absently&mdash;we heard a
clumping sound on the stairs, and a whispering outside the door,
which indeed once opened and shut as if by some invisible
agency.&nbsp; After a little while Martha came in, dragging after
her a great tall young man, all crimson with shyness, and finding
his only relief in perpetually sleeking down his hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, ma&rsquo;am, he&rsquo;s only Jem Hearn,&rdquo;
said Martha, by way of an introduction; and so out of breath was
she that I imagine she had had some bodily struggle before she
could overcome his reluctance to be presented on the courtly
scene of Miss Matilda Jenkyns&rsquo;s drawing-room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And please, ma&rsquo;am, he wants to marry me <a
name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
213</span>off-hand.&nbsp; And please, ma&rsquo;am, we want to
take a lodger&mdash;just one quiet lodger, to make our two ends
meet; and we&rsquo;d take any house conformable; and, oh dear
Miss Matty, if I may be so bold, would you have any objections to
lodging with us?&nbsp; Jem wants it as much as I do.&rdquo;&nbsp;
[To Jem ]&mdash;&ldquo;You great oaf! why can&rsquo;t you back
me!&mdash;But he does want it all the same, very
bad&mdash;don&rsquo;t you, Jem?&mdash;only, you see, he&rsquo;s
dazed at being called on to speak before quality.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p213b.jpg">

</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that,&rdquo; broke in Jem.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that you&rsquo;ve taken me all on a sudden, and
I didn&rsquo;t think for to get married so soon&mdash;and such
quick words does flabbergast a man.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not that
I&rsquo;m against it, ma&rsquo;am&rdquo; (addressing Miss Matty),
&ldquo;only Martha has such quick ways with her when once she
takes a thing into her head; and marriage,
ma&rsquo;am&mdash;marriage nails a man, as one may say.&nbsp; I
dare say I shan&rsquo;t mind it after it&rsquo;s once
over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Martha&mdash;who had
plucked at his sleeve, and nudged him with her elbow, and
otherwise tried to interrupt him all the time he had been
speaking&mdash;&ldquo;don&rsquo;t mind him, he&rsquo;ll come to;
&rsquo;twas only last night he was an-axing me, and an-axing me,
and all the more because I said I could not think of it for years
to come, and now he&rsquo;s only taken aback with the suddenness
of the joy; but you know, Jem, you are just as full as me about
wanting a lodger.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Another great nudge.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay! if Miss Matty would lodge with us&mdash;otherwise
I&rsquo;ve no mind to be cumbered with strange folk in the
house,&rdquo; said Jem, with a want of tact which I could see
enraged Martha, who was trying to represent a lodger as the great
object they wished <a name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
214</span>to obtain, and that, in fact, Miss Matty would be
smoothing their path and conferring a favour, if she would only
come and live with them.</p>
<p>Miss Matty herself was bewildered by the pair; their, or
rather Martha&rsquo;s sudden resolution in favour of matrimony
staggered her, and stood between her and the contemplation of the
plan which Martha had at heart.&nbsp; Miss Matty began&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marriage is a very solemn thing, Martha.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is indeed, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; quoth Jem.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Not that I&rsquo;ve no objections to Martha.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve never let me a-be for asking me for to fix
when I would be married,&rdquo; said Martha&mdash;her face all
a-fire, and ready to cry with vexation&mdash;&ldquo;and now
you&rsquo;re shaming me before my missus and all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, now!&nbsp; Martha don&rsquo;t ee! don&rsquo;t ee!
only a man likes to have breathing-time,&rdquo; said Jem, trying
to possess himself of her hand, but in vain.&nbsp; Then seeing
that she was more seriously hurt than he had imagined, he seemed
to try to rally his scattered faculties, and with more
straightforward dignity than, ten minutes before, I should have
thought it possible for him to assume, he turned to Miss Matty,
and said, &ldquo;I hope, ma&rsquo;am, you know that I am bound to
respect every one who has been kind to Martha.&nbsp; I always
looked on her as to be my wife&mdash;some time; and she has often
and often spoken of you as the kindest lady that ever was; and
though the plain truth is, I would not like to be troubled with
lodgers of the common run, yet if, ma&rsquo;am, you&rsquo;d
honour us by living with us, I&rsquo;m sure Martha would do her
best to make you comfortable; and I&rsquo;d keep out of your way
as much as I could, which I reckon would be <a
name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 215</span>the best
kindness such an awkward chap as me could do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Matty had been very busy with taking off her spectacles,
wiping them, and replacing them; but all she could say was,
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let any thought of me hurry you into marriage:
pray don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Marriage is such a very solemn
thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Miss Matilda will think of your plan,
Martha,&rdquo; said I, struck with the advantages that it
offered, and unwilling to lose the opportunity of considering
about it.&nbsp; &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m sure neither she nor I can
ever forget your kindness; nor your&rsquo;s either,
Jem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, ma&rsquo;am!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure I mean
kindly, though I&rsquo;m a bit fluttered by being pushed straight
ahead into matrimony, as it were, and mayn&rsquo;t express myself
conformable.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m willing enough,
and give me time to get accustomed; so, Martha, wench,
what&rsquo;s the use of crying so, and slapping me if I come
near?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This last was <i>sotto voce</i>, and had the effect of making
Martha bounce out of the room, to be followed and soothed by her
lover.&nbsp; Whereupon Miss Matty sat down and cried very
heartily, and accounted for it by saying that the thought of
Martha being married so soon gave her quite a shock, and that she
should never forgive herself if she thought she was hurrying the
poor creature.&nbsp; I think my pity was more for Jem, of the
two; but both Miss Matty and I appreciated to the full the
kindness of the honest couple, although we said little about
this, and a good deal about the chances and dangers of
matrimony.</p>
<p><a name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 216</span>The
next morning, very early, I received a note from Miss Pole, so
mysteriously wrapped up, and with so many seals on it to secure
secrecy, that I had to tear the paper before I could unfold
it.&nbsp; And when I came to the writing I could hardly
understand the meaning, it was so involved and oracular.&nbsp; I
made out, however, that I was to go to Miss Pole&rsquo;s at
eleven o&rsquo;clock; the number <i>eleven</i> being written in
full length as well as in numerals, and <i>A.M.</i> twice dashed
under, as if I were very likely to come at eleven at night, when
all Cranford was usually a-bed and asleep by ten.&nbsp; There was
no signature except Miss Pole&rsquo;s initials reversed, P.E.;
but as Martha had given me the note, &ldquo;with Miss
Pole&rsquo;s kind regards,&rdquo; it needed no wizard to find out
who sent it; and if the writer&rsquo;s name was to be kept
secret, it was very well that I was alone when Martha delivered
it.</p>
<p>I went as requested to Miss Pole&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The door was
opened to me by her little maid Lizzy in Sunday trim, as if some
grand event was impending over this work-day.&nbsp; And the
drawing-room upstairs was arranged in accordance with this
idea.&nbsp; The table was set out with the best green card-cloth,
and writing materials upon it.&nbsp; On the little chiffonier was
a tray with a newly-decanted bottle of cowslip wine, and some
ladies&rsquo;-finger biscuits.&nbsp; Miss Pole herself was in
solemn array, as if to receive visitors, although it was only
eleven o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; Mrs Forrester was there, crying
quietly and sadly, and my arrival seemed only to call forth fresh
tears.&nbsp; Before we had finished our greetings, performed with
lugubrious mystery of demeanour, there was another rat-tat-tat,
<a name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 217</span>and Mrs
Fitz-Adam appeared, crimson with walking and excitement.&nbsp; It
seemed as if this was all the company expected; for now Miss Pole
made several demonstrations of being about to open the business
of the meeting, by stirring the fire, opening and shutting the
door, and coughing and blowing her nose.&nbsp; Then she arranged
us all round the table, taking care to place me opposite to her;
and last of all, she inquired of me if the sad report was true,
as she feared it was, that Miss Matty had lost all her
fortune?</p>
<p>Of course, I had but one answer to make; and I never saw more
unaffected sorrow depicted on any countenances than I did there
on the three before me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish Mrs Jamieson was here!&rdquo; said Mrs Forrester
at last; but to judge from Mrs Fitz-Adam&rsquo;s face, she could
not second the wish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But without Mrs Jamieson,&rdquo; said Miss Pole, with
just a sound of offended merit in her voice, &ldquo;we, the
ladies of Cranford, in my drawing-room assembled, can resolve
upon something.&nbsp; I imagine we are none of us what may be
called rich, though we all possess a genteel competency,
sufficient for tastes that are elegant and refined, and would
not, if they could, be vulgarly ostentatious.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Here
I observed Miss Pole refer to a small card concealed in her hand,
on which I imagine she had put down a few notes.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Smith,&rdquo; she continued, addressing me
(familiarly known as &ldquo;Mary&rdquo; to all the company
assembled, but this was a state occasion), &ldquo;I have
conversed in private&mdash;I made it my business to do <a
name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 218</span>so
yesterday afternoon&mdash;with these ladies on the misfortune
which has happened to our friend, and one and all of us have
agreed that while we have a superfluity, it is not only a duty,
but a pleasure&mdash;a true pleasure, Mary!&rdquo;&mdash;her
voice was rather choked just here, and she had to wipe her
spectacles before she could go on&mdash;&ldquo;to give what we
can to assist her&mdash;Miss Matilda Jenkyns.&nbsp; Only in
consideration of the feelings of delicate independence existing
in the mind of every refined female&rdquo;&mdash;I was sure she
had got back to the card now&mdash;&ldquo;we wish to contribute
our mites in a secret and concealed manner, so as not to hurt the
feelings I have referred to.&nbsp; And our object in requesting
you to meet us this morning is that, believing you are the
daughter&mdash;that your father is, in fact, her confidential
adviser, in all pecuniary matters, we imagined that, by
consulting with him, you might devise some mode in which our
contribution could be made to appear the legal due which Miss
Matilda Jenkyns ought to receive from&mdash;&nbsp; Probably your
father, knowing her investments, can fill up the
blank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Pole concluded her address, and looked round for approval
and agreement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have expressed your meaning, ladies, have I
not?&nbsp; And while Miss Smith considers what reply to make,
allow me to offer you some little refreshment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had no great reply to make: I had more thankfulness at my
heart for their kind thoughts than I cared to put into words; and
so I only mumbled out something to the effect &ldquo;that I would
name what Miss Pole had said to my father, and that if anything
<a name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 219</span>could be
arranged for dear Miss Matty,&rdquo;&mdash;and here I broke down
utterly, and had to be refreshed with a glass of cowslip wine
before I could check the crying which had been repressed for the
last two or three days.&nbsp; The worst was, all the ladies cried
in concert.&nbsp; Even Miss Pole cried, who had said a hundred
times that to betray emotion before any one was a sign of
weakness and want of self-control.&nbsp; She recovered herself
into a slight degree of impatient anger, directed against me, as
having set them all off; and, moreover, I think she was vexed
that I could not make a speech back in return for hers; and if I
had known beforehand what was to be said, and had a card on which
to express the probable feelings that would rise in my heart, I
would have tried to gratify her.&nbsp; As it was, Mrs Forrester
was the person to speak when we had recovered our composure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind, among friends, stating that
I&mdash;no!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not poor exactly, but I don&rsquo;t
think I&rsquo;m what you may call rich; I wish I were, for dear
Miss Matty&rsquo;s sake&mdash;but, if you please, I&rsquo;ll
write down in a sealed paper what I can give.&nbsp; I only wish
it was more; my dear Mary, I do indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now I saw why paper, pens, and ink were provided.&nbsp; Every
lady wrote down the sum she could give annually, signed the
paper, and sealed it mysteriously.&nbsp; If their proposal was
acceded to, my father was to be allowed to open the papers, under
pledge of secrecy.&nbsp; If not, they were to be returned to
their writers.</p>
<p>When the ceremony had been gone through, I rose to depart; but
each lady seemed to wish to <a name="page220"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 220</span>have a private conference with
me.&nbsp; Miss Pole kept me in the drawing-room to explain why,
in Mrs Jamieson&rsquo;s absence, she had taken the lead in this
&ldquo;movement,&rdquo; as she was pleased to call it, and also
to inform me that she had heard from good sources that Mrs
Jamieson was coming home directly in a state of high displeasure
against her sister-in-law, who was forthwith to leave her house,
and was, she believed, to return to Edinburgh that very
afternoon.&nbsp; Of course this piece of intelligence could not
be communicated before Mrs Fitz-Adam, more especially as Miss
Pole was inclined to think that Lady Glenmire&rsquo;s engagement
to Mr Hoggins could not possibly hold against the blaze of Mrs
Jamieson&rsquo;s displeasure.&nbsp; A few hearty inquiries after
Miss Matty&rsquo;s health concluded my interview with Miss
Pole.</p>
<p>On coming downstairs I found Mrs Forrester waiting for me at
the entrance to the dining-parlour; she drew me in, and when the
door was shut, she tried two or three times to begin on some
subject, which was so unapproachable apparently, that I began to
despair of our ever getting to a clear understanding.&nbsp; At
last out it came; the poor old lady trembling all the time as if
it were a great crime which she was exposing to daylight, in
telling me how very, very little she had to live upon; a
confession which she was brought to make from a dread lest we
should think that the small contribution named in her paper bore
any proportion to her love and regard for Miss Matty.&nbsp; And
yet that sum which she so eagerly relinquished was, in truth,
more than a twentieth part of what she had to live upon, and keep
house, and a little serving-maid, all as became one born a <a
name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
221</span>Tyrrell.&nbsp; And when the whole income does not
nearly amount to a hundred pounds, to give up a twentieth of it
will necessitate many careful economies, and many pieces of
self-denial, small and insignificant in the world&rsquo;s
account, but bearing a different value in another account-book
that I have heard of.&nbsp; She did so wish she was rich, she
said, and this wish she kept repeating, with no thought of
herself in it, only with a longing, yearning desire to be able to
heap up Miss Matty&rsquo;s measure of comforts.</p>
<p>It was some time before I could console her enough to leave
her; and then, on quitting the house, I was waylaid by Mrs
Fitz-Adam, who had also her confidence to make of pretty nearly
the opposite description.&nbsp; She had not liked to put down all
that she could afford and was ready to give.&nbsp; She told me
she thought she never could look Miss Matty in the face again if
she presumed to be giving her so much as she should like to
do.&nbsp; &ldquo;Miss Matty!&rdquo; continued she, &ldquo;that I
thought was such a fine young lady when I was nothing but a
country girl, coming to market with eggs and butter and such like
things.&nbsp; For my father, though well-to-do, would always make
me go on as my mother had done before me, and I had to come into
Cranford every Saturday, and see after sales, and prices, and
what not.&nbsp; And one day, I remember, I met Miss Matty in the
lane that leads to Combehurst; she was walking on the footpath,
which, you know, is raised a good way above the road, and a
gentleman rode beside her, and was talking to her, and she was
looking down at some primroses she had gathered, and pulling them
all <a name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 222</span>to
pieces, and I do believe she was crying.&nbsp; But after she had
passed, she turned round and ran after me to ask&mdash;oh, so
kindly&mdash;about my poor mother, who lay on her death-bed; and
when I cried she took hold of my hand to comfort me&mdash;and the
gentleman waiting for her all the time&mdash;and her poor heart
very full of something, I am sure; and I thought it such an
honour to be spoken to in that pretty way by the rector&rsquo;s
daughter, who visited at Arley Hall.&nbsp; I have loved her ever
since, though perhaps I&rsquo;d no right to do it; but if you can
think of any way in which I might be allowed to give a little
more without any one knowing it, I should be so much obliged to
you, my dear.&nbsp; And my brother would be delighted to doctor
her for nothing&mdash;medicines, leeches, and all.&nbsp; I know
that he and her ladyship (my dear, I little thought in the days I
was telling you of that I should ever come to be sister-in-law to
a ladyship!) would do anything for her.&nbsp; We all
would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I told her I was quite sure of it, and promised all sorts of
things in my anxiety to get home to Miss Matty, who might well be
wondering what had become of me&mdash;absent from her two hours
without being able to account for it.&nbsp; She had taken very
little note of time, however, as she had been occupied in
numberless little arrangements preparatory to the great step of
giving up her house.&nbsp; It was evidently a relief to her to be
doing something in the way of retrenchment, for, as she said,
whenever she paused to think, the recollection of the poor fellow
with his bad five-pound note came over her, and she felt quite
dishonest; only if it made her so uncomfortable, <a
name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 223</span>what must
it not be doing to the directors of the bank, who must know so
much more of the misery consequent upon this failure?&nbsp; She
almost made me angry by dividing her sympathy between these
directors (whom she imagined overwhelmed by self-reproach for the
mismanagement of other people&rsquo;s affairs) and those who were
suffering like her.&nbsp; Indeed, of the two, she seemed to think
poverty a lighter burden than self-reproach; but I privately
doubted if the directors would agree with her.</p>
<p>Old hoards were taken out and examined as to their money value
which luckily was small, or else I don&rsquo;t know how Miss
Matty would have prevailed upon herself to part with such things
as her mother&rsquo;s wedding-ring, the strange, uncouth brooch
with which her father had disfigured his shirt-frill,
&amp;c.&nbsp; However, we arranged things a little in order as to
their pecuniary estimation, and were all ready for my father when
he came the next morning.</p>
<p>I am not going to weary you with the details of all the
business we went through; and one reason for not telling about
them is, that I did not understand what we were doing at the
time, and cannot recollect it now.&nbsp; Miss Matty and I sat
assenting to accounts, and schemes, and reports, and documents,
of which I do not believe we either of us understood a word; for
my father was clear-headed and decisive, and a capital man of
business, and if we made the slightest inquiry, or expressed the
slightest want of comprehension, he had a sharp way of saying,
&ldquo;Eh? eh? it&rsquo;s as clear as daylight.&nbsp;
What&rsquo;s your objection?&rdquo;&nbsp; And as we had not
comprehended anything of what he had proposed, we found it rather
difficult <a name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
224</span>to shape our objections; in fact, we never were sure if
we had any.&nbsp; So presently Miss Matty got into a nervously
acquiescent state, and said &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; at every pause, whether required or not;
but when I once joined in as chorus to a &ldquo;Decidedly,&rdquo;
pronounced by Miss Matty in a tremblingly dubious tone, my father
fired round at me and asked me &ldquo;What there was to
decide?&rdquo;&nbsp; And I am sure to this day I have never
known.&nbsp; But, in justice to him, I must say he had come over
from Drumble to help Miss Matty when he could ill spare the time,
and when his own affairs were in a very anxious state.</p>

</a></p>
<p>While Miss Matty was out of the room giving orders for
luncheon&mdash;and sadly perplexed between her desire of
honouring my father by a delicate, dainty meal, and her
conviction that she had no right, now that all her money was
gone, to indulge this desire&mdash;I told him of the meeting of
the Cranford ladies at Miss Pole&rsquo;s the day before.&nbsp; He
kept brushing his hand before his eyes as I spoke&mdash;and when
I went back to Martha&rsquo;s offer the evening before, of
receiving Miss Matty as a lodger, he fairly walked away from me
to the window, and began drumming with his fingers upon it.&nbsp;
Then he turned abruptly round, and said, &ldquo;See, Mary, how a
good, innocent life makes friends all around.&nbsp; Confound
it!&nbsp; I could make a good lesson out of it if I were a
parson; but, as it is, I can&rsquo;t get a tail to my
sentences&mdash;only I&rsquo;m sure you feel what I want to
say.&nbsp; You and I will have a walk after lunch and talk a bit
more about these plans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lunch&mdash;a hot savoury mutton-chop, and a <a
name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 225</span>little of
the cold loin sliced and fried&mdash;was now brought in.&nbsp;
Every morsel of this last dish was finished, to Martha&rsquo;s
great gratification.&nbsp; Then my father bluntly told Miss Matty
he wanted to talk to me alone, and that he would stroll out and
see some of the old places, and then I could tell her what plan
we thought desirable.&nbsp; Just before we went out, she called
me back and said, &ldquo;Remember, dear, I&rsquo;m the only one
left&mdash;I mean, there&rsquo;s no one to be hurt by what I
do.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m willing to do anything that&rsquo;s right and
honest; and I don&rsquo;t think, if Deborah knows where she is,
she&rsquo;ll care so very much if I&rsquo;m not genteel; because,
you see, she&rsquo;ll know all, dear.&nbsp; Only let me see what
I can do, and pay the poor people as far as I&rsquo;m
able.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I gave her a hearty kiss, and ran after my father.&nbsp; The
result of our conversation was this.&nbsp; If all parties were
agreeable, Martha and Jem were to be married with as little delay
as possible, and they were to live on in Miss Matty&rsquo;s
present abode; the sum which the Cranford ladies had agreed to
contribute annually being sufficient to meet the greater part of
the rent, and leaving Martha free to appropriate what Miss Matty
should pay for her lodgings to any little extra comforts
required.&nbsp; About the sale, my father was dubious at
first.&nbsp; He said the old rectory furniture, however carefully
used and reverently treated, would fetch very little; and that
little would be but as a drop in the sea of the debts of the Town
and County Bank.&nbsp; But when I represented how Miss
Matty&rsquo;s tender conscience would be soothed by feeling that
she had done what she could, he gave way; especially after I had
told him the <a name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
226</span>five-pound note adventure, and he had scolded me well
for allowing it.&nbsp; I then alluded to my idea that she might
add to her small income by selling tea; and, to my surprise (for
I had nearly given up the plan), my father grasped at it with all
the energy of a tradesman.&nbsp; I think he reckoned his chickens
before they were hatched, for he immediately ran up the profits
of the sales that she could effect in Cranford to more than
twenty pounds a year.&nbsp; The small dining-parlour was to be
converted into a shop, without any of its degrading
characteristics; a table was to be the counter; one window was to
be retained unaltered, and the other changed into a glass
door.&nbsp; I evidently rose in his estimation for having made
this bright suggestion.&nbsp; I only hoped we should not both
fall in Miss Matty&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>But she was patient and content with all our
arrangements.&nbsp; She knew, she said, that we should do the
best we could for her; and she only hoped, only stipulated, that
she should pay every farthing that she could be said to owe, for
her father&rsquo;s sake, who had been so respected in
Cranford.&nbsp; My father and I had agreed to say as little as
possible about the bank, indeed never to mention it again, if it
could be helped.&nbsp; Some of the plans were evidently a little
perplexing to her; but she had seen me sufficiently snubbed in
the morning for want of comprehension to venture on too many
inquiries now; and all passed over well with a hope on her part
that no one would be hurried into marriage on her account.&nbsp;
When we came to the proposal that she should sell tea, I could
see it was rather a shock to her; not on account of any personal
loss of gentility involved, but only because <a
name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 227</span>she
distrusted her own powers of action in a new line of life, and
would timidly have preferred a little more privation to any
exertion for which she feared she was unfitted.&nbsp; However,
when she saw my father was bent upon it, she sighed, and said she
would try; and if she did not do well, of course she might give
it up.&nbsp; One good thing about it was, she did not think men
ever bought tea; and it was of men particularly she was
afraid.&nbsp; They had such sharp loud ways with them; and did up
accounts, and counted their change so quickly!&nbsp; Now, if she
might only sell comfits to children, she was sure she could
please them!</p>
<h2><a name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
228</span>CHAPTER XV&mdash;A HAPPY RETURN</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Before</span> I left Miss Matty at
Cranford everything had been comfortably arranged for her.&nbsp;
Even Mrs Jamieson&rsquo;s approval of her selling tea had been
gained.&nbsp; That oracle had taken a few days to consider
whether by so doing Miss Matty would forfeit her right to the
privileges of society in Cranford.&nbsp; I think she had some
little idea of mortifying Lady Glenmire by the decision she gave
at last; which was to this effect: that whereas a married woman
takes her husband&rsquo;s rank by the strict laws of precedence,
an unmarried woman retains the station her father occupied.&nbsp;
So Cranford was allowed to visit Miss Matty; and, whether allowed
or not, it intended to visit Lady Glenmire.</p>
<p>But what was our surprise&mdash;our dismay&mdash;when we
learnt that Mr and <i>Mrs Hoggins</i> were returning on the
following Tuesday!&nbsp; Mrs Hoggins!&nbsp; Had she absolutely
dropped her title, and so, in a spirit of bravado, cut the
aristocracy to become a Hoggins!&nbsp; She, who might have been
called Lady Glenmire to her dying day!&nbsp; Mrs Jamieson was
pleased.&nbsp; She said it only convinced her of what she had
known <a name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
229</span>from the first, that the creature had a low
taste.&nbsp; But &ldquo;the creature&rdquo; looked very happy on
Sunday at church; nor did we see it necessary to keep our veils
down on that side of our bonnets on which Mr and Mrs Hoggins sat,
as Mrs Jamieson did; thereby missing all the smiling glory of his
face, and all the becoming blushes of hers.&nbsp; I am not sure
if Martha and Jem looked more radiant in the afternoon, when
they, too, made their first appearance.&nbsp; Mrs Jamieson
soothed the turbulence of her soul by having the blinds of her
windows drawn down, as if for a funeral, on the day when Mr and
Mrs Hoggins received callers; and it was with some difficulty
that she was prevailed upon to continue the <i>St James&rsquo;s
Chronicle</i>, so indignant was she with its having inserted the
announcement of the marriage.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>Miss Matty&rsquo;s sale went off famously.&nbsp; She retained
the furniture of her sitting-room and bedroom; the former of
which she was to occupy till Martha could meet with a lodger who
might wish to take it; and into this sitting-room and bedroom she
had to cram all sorts of things, which were (the auctioneer
assured her) bought in for her at the sale by an unknown
friend.&nbsp; I always suspected Mrs Fitz-Adam of this; but she
must have had an accessory, who knew what articles were
particularly regarded by Miss Matty on account of their
associations with her early days.&nbsp; The rest of the house
looked rather bare, to be sure; all except one tiny bedroom, of
which my father allowed me to purchase the furniture for my
occasional use in case of Miss Matty&rsquo;s illness.</p>
<p>I had expended my own small store in buying all manner of
comfits and lozenges, in order to tempt <a
name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 230</span>the little
people whom Miss Matty loved so much to come about her.&nbsp; Tea
in bright green canisters, and comfits in tumblers&mdash;Miss
Matty and I felt quite proud as we looked round us on the evening
before the shop was to be opened.&nbsp; Martha had scoured the
boarded floor to a white cleanness, and it was adorned with a
brilliant piece of oil-cloth, on which customers were to stand
before the table-counter.&nbsp; The wholesome smell of plaster
and whitewash pervaded the apartment.&nbsp; A very small
&ldquo;Matilda Jenkyns, licensed to sell tea,&rdquo; was hidden
under the lintel of the new door, and two boxes of tea, with
cabalistic inscriptions all over them, stood ready to disgorge
their contents into the canisters.</p>
<p>Miss Matty, as I ought to have mentioned before, had had some
scruples of conscience at selling tea when there was already Mr
Johnson in the town, who included it among his numerous
commodities; and, before she could quite reconcile herself to the
adoption of her new business, she had trotted down to his shop,
unknown to me, to tell him of the project that was entertained,
and to inquire if it was likely to injure his business.&nbsp; My
father called this idea of hers &ldquo;great nonsense,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;wondered how tradespeople were to get on if there was to
be a continual consulting of each other&rsquo;s interests, which
would put a stop to all competition directly.&rdquo;&nbsp; And,
perhaps, it would not have done in Drumble, but in Cranford it
answered very well; for not only did Mr Johnson kindly put at
rest all Miss Matty&rsquo;s scruples and fear of injuring his
business, but I have reason to know he repeatedly sent customers
to her, saying that the teas he kept were of a common kind, but
that <a name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
231</span>Miss Jenkyns had all the choice sorts.&nbsp; And
expensive tea is a very favourite luxury with well-to-do
tradespeople and rich farmers&rsquo; wives, who turn up their
noses at the Congou and Souchong prevalent at many tables of
gentility, and will have nothing else than Gunpowder and Pekoe
for themselves.</p>
<p>But to return to Miss Matty.&nbsp; It was really very pleasant
to see how her unselfishness and simple sense of justice called
out the same good qualities in others.&nbsp; She never seemed to
think any one would impose upon her, because she should be so
grieved to do it to them.&nbsp; I have heard her put a stop to
the asseverations of the man who brought her coals by quietly
saying, &ldquo;I am sure you would be sorry to bring me wrong
weight;&rdquo; and if the coals were short measure that time, I
don&rsquo;t believe they ever were again.&nbsp; People would have
felt as much ashamed of presuming on her good faith as they would
have done on that of a child.&nbsp; But my father says
&ldquo;such simplicity might be very well in Cranford, but would
never do in the world.&rdquo;&nbsp; And I fancy the world must be
very bad, for with all my father&rsquo;s suspicion of every one
with whom he has dealings, and in spite of all his many
precautions, he lost upwards of a thousand pounds by roguery only
last year.</p>
<p>I just stayed long enough to establish Miss Matty in her new
mode of life, and to pack up the library, which the rector had
purchased.&nbsp; He had written a very kind letter to Miss Matty,
saying &ldquo;how glad he should be to take a library, so well
selected as he knew that the late Mr Jenkyns&rsquo;s must have
been, at any valuation put upon them.&rdquo;&nbsp; And when she
agreed to this, with a touch of sorrowful <a
name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 232</span>gladness
that they would go back to the rectory and be arranged on the
accustomed walls once more, he sent word that he feared that he
had not room for them all, and perhaps Miss Matty would kindly
allow him to leave some volumes on her shelves.&nbsp; But Miss
Matty said that she had her Bible and &ldquo;Johnson&rsquo;s
Dictionary,&rdquo; and should not have much time for reading, she
was afraid; still, I retained a few books out of consideration
for the rector&rsquo;s kindness.</p>
<p>The money which he had paid, and that produced by the sale,
was partly expended in the stock of tea, and part of it was
invested against a rainy day&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> old age or
illness.&nbsp; It was but a small sum, it is true; and it
occasioned a few evasions of truth and white lies (all of which I
think very wrong indeed&mdash;in theory&mdash;and would rather
not put them in practice), for we knew Miss Matty would be
perplexed as to her duty if she were aware of any little
reserve-fund being made for her while the debts of the bank
remained unpaid.&nbsp; Moreover, she had never been told of the
way in which her friends were contributing to pay the rent.&nbsp;
I should have liked to tell her this, but the mystery of the
affair gave a piquancy to their deed of kindness which the ladies
were unwilling to give up; and at first Martha had to shirk many
a perplexed question as to her ways and means of living in such a
house, but by-and-by Miss Matty&rsquo;s prudent uneasiness sank
down into acquiescence with the existing arrangement.</p>
<p>I left Miss Matty with a good heart.&nbsp; Her sales of tea
during the first two days had surpassed my most sanguine
expectations.&nbsp; The whole country round seemed to be all out
of tea at once.&nbsp; The only <a name="page233"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 233</span>alteration I could have desired in
Miss Matty&rsquo;s way of doing business was, that she should not
have so plaintively entreated some of her customers not to buy
green tea&mdash;running it down as a slow poison, sure to destroy
the nerves, and produce all manner of evil.&nbsp; Their
pertinacity in taking it, in spite of all her warnings,
distressed her so much that I really thought she would relinquish
the sale of it, and so lose half her custom; and I was driven to
my wits&rsquo; end for instances of longevity entirely
attributable to a persevering use of green tea.&nbsp; But the
final argument, which settled the question, was a happy reference
of mine to the train-oil and tallow candles which the Esquimaux
not only enjoy but digest.&nbsp; After that she acknowledged that
&ldquo;one man&rsquo;s meat might be another man&rsquo;s
poison,&rdquo; and contented herself thence-forward with an
occasional remonstrance when she thought the purchaser was too
young and innocent to be acquainted with the evil effects green
tea produced on some constitutions, and an habitual sigh when
people old enough to choose more wisely would prefer it.</p>
<p>I went over from Drumble once a quarter at least to settle the
accounts, and see after the necessary business letters.&nbsp;
And, speaking of letters, I began to be very much ashamed of
remembering my letter to the Aga Jenkyns, and very glad I had
never named my writing to any one.&nbsp; I only hoped the letter
was lost.&nbsp; No answer came.&nbsp; No sign was made.</p>
<p>About a year after Miss Matty set up shop, I received one of
Martha&rsquo;s hieroglyphics, begging me to come to Cranford very
soon.&nbsp; I was afraid that Miss Matty was ill, and went off
that very afternoon, <a name="page234"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 234</span>and took Martha by surprise when she
saw me on opening the door.&nbsp; We went into the kitchen as
usual, to have our confidential conference, and then Martha told
me she was expecting her confinement very soon&mdash;in a week or
two; and she did not think Miss Matty was aware of it, and she
wanted me to break the news to her, &ldquo;for indeed,
miss,&rdquo; continued Martha, crying hysterically,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid she won&rsquo;t approve of it, and
I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know who is to take care of her as
she should be taken care of when I am laid up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I comforted Martha by telling her I would remain till she was
about again, and only wished she had told me her reason for this
sudden summons, as then I would have brought the requisite stock
of clothes.&nbsp; But Martha was so tearful and tender-spirited,
and unlike her usual self, that I said as little as possible
about myself, and endeavoured rather to comfort Martha under all
the probable and possible misfortunes which came crowding upon
her imagination.</p>
<p>I then stole out of the house-door, and made my appearance as
if I were a customer in the shop, just to take Miss Matty by
surprise, and gain an idea of how she looked in her new
situation.&nbsp; It was warm May weather, so only the little
half-door was closed; and Miss Matty sat behind the counter,
knitting an elaborate pair of garters; elaborate they seemed to
me, but the difficult stitch was no weight upon her mind, for she
was singing in a low voice to herself as her needles went rapidly
in and out.&nbsp; I call it singing, but I dare say a musician
would not use that word to the tuneless yet sweet humming of the
low worn <a name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
235</span>voice.&nbsp; I found out from the words, far more than
from the attempt at the tune, that it was the Old Hundredth she
was crooning to herself; but the quiet continuous sound told of
content, and gave me a pleasant feeling, as I stood in the street
just outside the door, quite in harmony with that soft May
morning.&nbsp; I went in.&nbsp; At first she did not catch who it
was, and stood up as if to serve me; but in another minute
watchful pussy had clutched her knitting, which was dropped in
eager joy at seeing me.&nbsp; I found, after we had had a little
conversation, that it was as Martha said, and that Miss Matty had
no idea of the approaching household event.&nbsp; So I thought I
would let things take their course, secure that when I went to
her with the baby in my arms, I should obtain that forgiveness
for Martha which she was needlessly frightening herself into
believing that Miss Matty would withhold, under some notion that
the new claimant would require attentions from its mother that it
would be faithless treason to Miss Matty to render.</p>
<p>But I was right.&nbsp; I think that must be an hereditary
quality, for my father says he is scarcely ever wrong.&nbsp; One
morning, within a week after I arrived, I went to call Miss
Matty, with a little bundle of flannel in my arms.&nbsp; She was
very much awe-struck when I showed her what it was, and asked for
her spectacles off the dressing-table, and looked at it
curiously, with a sort of tender wonder at its small perfection
of parts.&nbsp; She could not banish the thought of the surprise
all day, but went about on tiptoe, and was very silent.&nbsp; But
she stole up to see Martha and they both cried with joy, and <a
name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 236</span>she got
into a complimentary speech to Jem, and did not know how to get
out of it again, and was only extricated from her dilemma by the
sound of the shop-bell, which was an equal relief to the shy,
proud, honest Jem, who shook my hand so vigorously when I
congratulated him, that I think I feel the pain of it yet.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p234b.jpg">
<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>I had a busy life while Martha was laid up.&nbsp; I attended
on Miss Matty, and prepared her meals; I cast up her accounts,
and examined into the state of her canisters and tumblers.&nbsp;
I helped her, too, occasionally, in the shop; and it gave me no
small amusement, and sometimes a little uneasiness, to watch her
ways there.&nbsp; If a little child came in to ask for an ounce
of almond-comfits (and four of the large kind which Miss Matty
sold weighed that much), she always added one more by &ldquo;way
of make-weight,&rdquo; as she called it, although the scale was
handsomely turned before; and when I remonstrated against this,
her reply was, &ldquo;The little things like it so
much!&rdquo;&nbsp; There was no use in telling her that the fifth
comfit weighed a quarter of an ounce, and made every sale into a
loss to her pocket.&nbsp; So I remembered the green tea, and
winged my shaft with a feather out of her own plumage.&nbsp; I
told her how unwholesome almond-comfits were, and how ill excess
in them might make the little children.&nbsp; This argument
produced some effect; for, henceforward, instead of the fifth
comfit, she always told them to hold out their tiny palms, into
which she shook either peppermint or ginger lozenges, as a
preventive to the dangers that might arise from the previous
sale.&nbsp; Altogether the lozenge trade, conducted on these
principles, did <a name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
237</span>not promise to be remunerative; but I was happy to find
she had made more than twenty pounds during the last year by her
sales of tea; and, moreover, that now she was accustomed to it,
she did not dislike the employment, which brought her into kindly
intercourse with many of the people round about.&nbsp; If she
gave them good weight, they, in their turn, brought many a little
country present to the &ldquo;old rector&rsquo;s daughter&rdquo;;
a cream cheese, a few new-laid eggs, a little fresh ripe fruit, a
bunch of flowers.&nbsp; The counter was quite loaded with these
offerings sometimes, as she told me.</p>
<p>As for Cranford in general, it was going on much as
usual.&nbsp; The Jamieson and Hoggins feud still raged, if a feud
it could be called, when only one side cared much about it.&nbsp;
Mr and Mrs Hoggins were very happy together, and, like most very
happy people, quite ready to be friendly; indeed, Mrs Hoggins was
really desirous to be restored to Mrs Jamieson&rsquo;s good
graces, because of the former intimacy.&nbsp; But Mrs Jamieson
considered their very happiness an insult to the Glenmire family,
to which she had still the honour to belong, and she doggedly
refused and rejected every advance.&nbsp; Mr Mulliner, like a
faithful clansman, espoused his mistress&rsquo; side with
ardour.&nbsp; If he saw either Mr or Mrs Hoggins, he would cross
the street, and appear absorbed in the contemplation of life in
general, and his own path in particular, until he had passed them
by.&nbsp; Miss Pole used to amuse herself with wondering what in
the world Mrs Jamieson would do, if either she, or Mr Mulliner,
or any other member of her household was taken ill; she could
hardly have the face to call in <a name="page238"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 238</span>Mr Hoggins after the way she had
behaved to them.&nbsp; Miss Pole grew quite impatient for some
indisposition or accident to befall Mrs Jamieson or her
dependents, in order that Cranford might see how she would act
under the perplexing circumstances.</p>
<p>Martha was beginning to go about again, and I had already
fixed a limit, not very far distant, to my visit, when one
afternoon, as I was sitting in the shop-parlour with Miss
Matty&mdash;I remember the weather was colder now than it had
been in May, three weeks before, and we had a fire and kept the
door fully closed&mdash;we saw a gentleman go slowly past the
window, and then stand opposite to the door, as if looking out
for the name which we had so carefully hidden.&nbsp; He took out
a double eyeglass and peered about for some time before he could
discover it.&nbsp; Then he came in.&nbsp; And, all on a sudden,
it flashed across me that it was the Aga himself!&nbsp; For his
clothes had an out-of-the-way foreign cut about them, and his
face was deep brown, as if tanned and re-tanned by the sun.&nbsp;
His complexion contrasted oddly with his plentiful snow-white
hair, his eyes were dark and piercing, and he had an odd way of
contracting them and puckering up his cheeks into innumerable
wrinkles when he looked earnestly at objects.&nbsp; He did so to
Miss Matty when he first came in.&nbsp; His glance had first
caught and lingered a little upon me, but then turned, with the
peculiar searching look I have described, to Miss Matty.&nbsp;
She was a little fluttered and nervous, but no more so than she
always was when any man came into her shop.&nbsp; She thought
that he would probably have a note, or a sovereign at least, for
which she would <a name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
239</span>have to give change, which was an operation she very
much disliked to perform.&nbsp; But the present customer stood
opposite to her, without asking for anything, only looking
fixedly at her as he drummed upon the table with his fingers,
just for all the world as Miss Jenkyns used to do.&nbsp; Miss
Matty was on the point of asking him what he wanted (as she told
me afterwards), when he turned sharp to me: &ldquo;Is your name
Mary Smith?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>All my doubts as to his identity were set at rest, and I only
wondered what he would say or do next, and how Miss Matty would
stand the joyful shock of what he had to reveal.&nbsp; Apparently
he was at a loss how to announce himself, for he looked round at
last in search of something to buy, so as to gain time, and, as
it happened, his eye caught on the almond-comfits, and he boldly
asked for a pound of &ldquo;those things.&rdquo;&nbsp; I doubt if
Miss Matty had a whole pound in the shop, and, besides the
unusual magnitude of the order, she was distressed with the idea
of the indigestion they would produce, taken in such unlimited
quantities.&nbsp; She looked up to remonstrate.&nbsp; Something
of tender relaxation in his face struck home to her heart.&nbsp;
She said, &ldquo;It is&mdash;oh, sir! can you be Peter?&rdquo;
and trembled from head to foot.&nbsp; In a moment he was round
the table and had her in his arms, sobbing the tearless cries of
old age.&nbsp; I brought her a glass of wine, for indeed her
colour had changed so as to alarm me and Mr Peter too.&nbsp; He
kept saying, &ldquo;I have been too sudden for you, Matty&mdash;I
have, my little girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I proposed that she should go at once up into the <a
name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
240</span>drawing-room and lie down on the sofa there.&nbsp; She
looked wistfully at her brother, whose hand she had held tight,
even when nearly fainting; but on his assuring her that he would
not leave her, she allowed him to carry her upstairs.</p>
<p>I thought that the best I could do was to run and put the
kettle on the fire for early tea, and then to attend to the shop,
leaving the brother and sister to exchange some of the many
thousand things they must have to say.&nbsp; I had also to break
the news to Martha, who received it with a burst of tears which
nearly infected me.&nbsp; She kept recovering herself to ask if I
was sure it was indeed Miss Matty&rsquo;s brother, for I had
mentioned that he had grey hair, and she had always heard that he
was a very handsome young man.&nbsp; Something of the same kind
perplexed Miss Matty at tea-time, when she was installed in the
great easy-chair opposite to Mr Jenkyns in order to gaze her
fill.&nbsp; She could hardly drink for looking at him, and as for
eating, that was out of the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose hot climates age people very quickly,&rdquo;
said she, almost to herself.&nbsp; &ldquo;When you left Cranford
you had not a grey hair in your head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how many years ago is that?&rdquo; said Mr Peter,
smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, true! yes, I suppose you and I are getting
old.&nbsp; But still I did not think we were so very old!&nbsp;
But white hair is very becoming to you, Peter,&rdquo; she
continued&mdash;a little afraid lest she had hurt him by
revealing how his appearance had impressed her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose I forgot dates too, Matty, for what do you
think I have brought for you from India?&nbsp; I have an Indian
muslin gown and a pearl necklace for you <a
name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 241</span>somewhere
in my chest at Portsmouth.&rdquo;&nbsp; He smiled as if amused at
the idea of the incongruity of his presents with the appearance
of his sister; but this did not strike her all at once, while the
elegance of the articles did.&nbsp; I could see that for a moment
her imagination dwelt complacently on the idea of herself thus
attired; and instinctively she put her hand up to her
throat&mdash;that little delicate throat which (as Miss Pole had
told me) had been one of her youthful charms; but the hand met
the touch of folds of soft muslin in which she was always swathed
up to her chin, and the sensation recalled a sense of the
unsuitableness of a pearl necklace to her age.&nbsp; She said,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m too old; but it was very kind
of you to think of it.&nbsp; They are just what I should have
liked years ago&mdash;when I was young.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I thought, my little Matty.&nbsp; I remembered your
tastes; they were so like my dear mother&rsquo;s.&rdquo;&nbsp; At
the mention of that name the brother and sister clasped each
other&rsquo;s hands yet more fondly, and, although they were
perfectly silent, I fancied they might have something to say if
they were unchecked by my presence, and I got up to arrange my
room for Mr Peter&rsquo;s occupation that night, intending myself
to share Miss Matty&rsquo;s bed.&nbsp; But at my movement, he
started up.&nbsp; &ldquo;I must go and settle about a room at the
&lsquo;George.&rsquo;&nbsp; My carpet-bag is there
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; said Miss Matty, in great
distress&mdash;&ldquo;you must not go; please, dear
Peter&mdash;pray, Mary&mdash;oh! you must not go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was so much agitated that we both promised everything she
wished.&nbsp; Peter sat down again and gave her his hand, which
for better security she held <a name="page242"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 242</span>in both of hers, and I left the room
to accomplish my arrangements.</p>
<p>Long, long into the night, far, far into the morning, did Miss
Matty and I talk.&nbsp; She had much to tell me of her
brother&rsquo;s life and adventures, which he had communicated to
her as they had sat alone.&nbsp; She said all was thoroughly
clear to her; but I never quite understood the whole story; and
when in after days I lost my awe of Mr Peter enough to question
him myself, he laughed at my curiosity, and told me stories that
sounded so very much like Baron Munchausen&rsquo;s, that I was
sure he was making fun of me.&nbsp; What I heard from Miss Matty
was that he had been a volunteer at the siege of Rangoon; had
been taken prisoner by the Burmese; and somehow obtained favour
and eventual freedom from knowing how to bleed the chief of the
small tribe in some case of dangerous illness; that on his
release from years of captivity he had had his letters returned
from England with the ominous word &ldquo;Dead&rdquo; marked upon
them; and, believing himself to be the last of his race, he had
settled down as an indigo planter, and had proposed to spend the
remainder of his life in the country to whose inhabitants and
modes of life he had become habituated, when my letter had
reached him; and, with the odd vehemence which characterised him
in age as it had done in youth, he had sold his land and all his
possessions to the first purchaser, and come home to the poor old
sister, who was more glad and rich than any princess when she
looked at him.&nbsp; She talked me to sleep at last, and then I
was awakened by a slight sound at the door, for which she begged
my pardon as she crept penitently into bed; but it <a
name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 243</span>seems that
when I could no longer confirm her belief that the long-lost was
really here&mdash;under the same roof&mdash;she had begun to fear
lest it was only a waking dream of hers; that there never had
been a Peter sitting by her all that blessed evening&mdash;but
that the real Peter lay dead far away beneath some wild sea-wave,
or under some strange eastern tree.&nbsp; And so strong had this
nervous feeling of hers become, that she was fain to get up and
go and convince herself that he was really there by listening
through the door to his even, regular breathing&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t like to call it snoring, but I heard it myself
through two closed doors&mdash;and by-and-by it soothed Miss
Matty to sleep.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe Mr Peter came home from India as rich as
a nabob; he even considered himself poor, but neither he nor Miss
Matty cared much about that.&nbsp; At any rate, he had enough to
live upon &ldquo;very genteelly&rdquo; at Cranford; he and Miss
Matty together.&nbsp; And a day or two after his arrival, the
shop was closed, while troops of little urchins gleefully awaited
the shower of comfits and lozenges that came from time to time
down upon their faces as they stood up-gazing at Miss
Matty&rsquo;s drawing-room windows.&nbsp; Occasionally Miss Matty
would say to them (half-hidden behind the curtains), &ldquo;My
dear children, don&rsquo;t make yourselves ill;&rdquo; but a
strong arm pulled her back, and a more rattling shower than ever
succeeded.&nbsp; A part of the tea was sent in presents to the
Cranford ladies; and some of it was distributed among the old
people who remembered Mr Peter in the days of his frolicsome
youth.&nbsp; The Indian muslin gown was reserved for darling
Flora Gordon (Miss Jessie Brown&rsquo;s daughter).&nbsp; The <a
name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 244</span>Gordons had
been on the Continent for the last few years, but were now
expected to return very soon; and Miss Matty, in her sisterly
pride, anticipated great delight in the joy of showing them Mr
Peter.&nbsp; The pearl necklace disappeared; and about that time
many handsome and useful presents made their appearance in the
households of Miss Pole and Mrs Forrester; and some rare and
delicate Indian ornaments graced the drawing-rooms of Mrs
Jamieson and Mrs Fitz-Adam.&nbsp; I myself was not
forgotten.&nbsp; Among other things, I had the handsomest-bound
and best edition of Dr Johnson&rsquo;s works that could be
procured; and dear Miss Matty, with tears in her eyes, begged me
to consider it as a present from her sister as well as
herself.&nbsp; In short, no one was forgotten; and, what was
more, every one, however insignificant, who had shown kindness to
Miss Matty at any time, was sure of Mr Peter&rsquo;s cordial
regard.</p>
<h2><a name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
245</span>CHAPTER XVI&mdash;PEACE TO CRANFORD</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was not surprising that Mr Peter
became such a favourite at Cranford.&nbsp; The ladies vied with
each other who should admire him most; and no wonder, for their
quiet lives were astonishingly stirred up by the arrival from
India&mdash;especially as the person arrived told more wonderful
stories than Sindbad the Sailor; and, as Miss Pole said, was
quite as good as an Arabian Night any evening.&nbsp; For my own
part, I had vibrated all my life between Drumble and Cranford,
and I thought it was quite possible that all Mr Peter&rsquo;s
stories might be true, although wonderful; but when I found that,
if we swallowed an anecdote of tolerable magnitude one week, we
had the dose considerably increased the next, I began to have my
doubts; especially as I noticed that when his sister was present
the accounts of Indian life were comparatively tame; not that she
knew more than we did, perhaps less.&nbsp; I noticed also that
when the rector came to call, Mr Peter talked in a different way
about the countries he had been in.&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t think
the ladies in Cranford would have considered him such a wonderful
traveller if they had only heard <a name="page246"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 246</span>him talk in the quiet way he did to
him.&nbsp; They liked him the better, indeed, for being what they
called &ldquo;so very Oriental.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One day, at a select party in his honour, which Miss Pole
gave, and from which, as Mrs Jamieson honoured it with her
presence, and had even offered to send Mr Mulliner to wait, Mr
and Mrs Hoggins and Mrs Fitz-Adam were necessarily
excluded&mdash;one day at Miss Pole&rsquo;s, Mr Peter said he was
tired of sitting upright against the hard-backed uneasy chairs,
and asked if he might not indulge himself in sitting
cross-legged.&nbsp; Miss Pole&rsquo;s consent was eagerly given,
and down he went with the utmost gravity.&nbsp; But when Miss
Pole asked me, in an audible whisper, &ldquo;if he did not remind
me of the Father of the Faithful?&rdquo; I could not help
thinking of poor Simon Jones, the lame tailor, and while Mrs
Jamieson slowly commented on the elegance and convenience of the
attitude, I remembered how we had all followed that lady&rsquo;s
lead in condemning Mr Hoggins for vulgarity because he simply
crossed his legs as he sat still on his chair.&nbsp; Many of Mr
Peter&rsquo;s ways of eating were a little strange amongst such
ladies as Miss Pole, and Miss Matty, and Mrs Jamieson, especially
when I recollected the untasted green peas and two-pronged forks
at poor Mr Holbrook&rsquo;s dinner.</p>
<p>The mention of that gentleman&rsquo;s name recalls to my mind
a conversation between Mr Peter and Miss Matty one evening in the
summer after he returned to Cranford.&nbsp; The day had been very
hot, and Miss Matty had been much oppressed by the weather, in
the heat of which her brother revelled.&nbsp; I remember that she
had been unable to nurse Martha&rsquo;s baby, <a
name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 247</span>which had
become her favourite employment of late, and which was as much at
home in her arms as in its mother&rsquo;s, as long as it remained
a light-weight, portable by one so fragile as Miss Matty.&nbsp;
This day to which I refer, Miss Matty had seemed more than
usually feeble and languid, and only revived when the sun went
down, and her sofa was wheeled to the open window, through which,
although it looked into the principal street of Cranford, the
fragrant smell of the neighbouring hayfields came in every now
and then, borne by the soft breezes that stirred the dull air of
the summer twilight, and then died away.&nbsp; The silence of the
sultry atmosphere was lost in the murmuring noises which came in
from many an open window and door; even the children were abroad
in the street, late as it was (between ten and eleven), enjoying
the game of play for which they had not had spirits during the
heat of the day.&nbsp; It was a source of satisfaction to Miss
Matty to see how few candles were lighted, even in the apartments
of those houses from which issued the greatest signs of
life.&nbsp; Mr Peter, Miss Matty, and I had all been quiet, each
with a separate reverie, for some little time, when Mr Peter
broke in&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know, little Matty, I could have sworn you were
on the high road to matrimony when I left England that last
time!&nbsp; If anybody had told me you would have lived and died
an old maid then, I should have laughed in their
faces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Matty made no reply, and I tried in vain to think of some
subject which should effectually turn the conversation; but I was
very stupid; and before I spoke he went on&mdash;</p>
<p><a name="page248"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
248</span>&ldquo;It was Holbrook, that fine manly fellow who
lived at Woodley, that I used to think would carry off my little
Matty.&nbsp; You would not think it now, I dare say, Mary; but
this sister of mine was once a very pretty girl&mdash;at least, I
thought so, and so I&rsquo;ve a notion did poor Holbrook.&nbsp;
What business had he to die before I came home to thank him for
all his kindness to a good-for-nothing cub as I was?&nbsp; It was
that that made me first think he cared for you; for in all our
fishing expeditions it was Matty, Matty, we talked about.&nbsp;
Poor Deborah!&nbsp; What a lecture she read me on having asked
him home to lunch one day, when she had seen the Arley carriage
in the town, and thought that my lady might call.&nbsp; Well,
that&rsquo;s long years ago; more than half a life-time, and yet
it seems like yesterday!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know a fellow I
should have liked better as a brother-in-law.&nbsp; You must have
played your cards badly, my little Matty, somehow or
another&mdash;wanted your brother to be a good go-between, eh,
little one?&rdquo; said he, putting out his hand to take hold of
hers as she lay on the sofa.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s this?
you&rsquo;re shivering and shaking, Matty, with that confounded
open window.&nbsp; Shut it, Mary, this minute!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did so, and then stooped down to kiss Miss Matty, and see if
she really were chilled.&nbsp; She caught at my hand, and gave it
a hard squeeze&mdash;but unconsciously, I think&mdash;for in a
minute or two she spoke to us quite in her usual voice, and
smiled our uneasiness away, although she patiently submitted to
the prescriptions we enforced of a warm bed and a glass of weak
negus.&nbsp; I was to leave Cranford the next day, and before I
went I saw that all the effects <a name="page249"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 249</span>of the open window had quite
vanished.&nbsp; I had superintended most of the alterations
necessary in the house and household during the latter weeks of
my stay.&nbsp; The shop was once more a parlour: the empty
resounding rooms again furnished up to the very garrets.</p>
<p>There had been some talk of establishing Martha and Jem in
another house, but Miss Matty would not hear of this.&nbsp;
Indeed, I never saw her so much roused as when Miss Pole had
assumed it to be the most desirable arrangement.&nbsp; As long as
Martha would remain with Miss Matty, Miss Matty was only too
thankful to have her about her; yes, and Jem too, who was a very
pleasant man to have in the house, for she never saw him from
week&rsquo;s end to week&rsquo;s end.&nbsp; And as for the
probable children, if they would all turn out such little
darlings as her god-daughter, Matilda, she should not mind the
number, if Martha didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Besides, the next was to be
called Deborah&mdash;a point which Miss Matty had reluctantly
yielded to Martha&rsquo;s stubborn determination that her
first-born was to be Matilda.&nbsp; So Miss Pole had to lower her
colours, and even her voice, as she said to me that, as Mr and
Mrs Hearn were still to go on living in the same house with Miss
Matty, we had certainly done a wise thing in hiring
Martha&rsquo;s niece as an auxiliary.</p>
<p>I left Miss Matty and Mr Peter most comfortable and contented;
the only subject for regret to the tender heart of the one, and
the social friendly nature of the other, being the unfortunate
quarrel between Mrs Jamieson and the plebeian Hogginses and their
following.&nbsp; In joke, I prophesied one day <a
name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 250</span>that this
would only last until Mrs Jamieson or Mr Mulliner were ill, in
which case they would only be too glad to be friends with Mr
Hoggins; but Miss Matty did not like my looking forward to
anything like illness in so light a manner, and before the year
was out all had come round in a far more satisfactory way.</p>
<p>I received two Cranford letters on one auspicious October
morning.&nbsp; Both Miss Pole and Miss Matty wrote to ask me to
come over and meet the Gordons, who had returned to England alive
and well with their two children, now almost grown up.&nbsp; Dear
Jessie Brown had kept her old kind nature, although she had
changed her name and station; and she wrote to say that she and
Major Gordon expected to be in Cranford on the fourteenth, and
she hoped and begged to be remembered to Mrs Jamieson (named
first, as became her honourable station), Miss Pole and Miss
Matty&mdash;could she ever forget their kindness to her poor
father and sister?&mdash;Mrs Forrester, Mr Hoggins (and here
again came in an allusion to kindness shown to the dead long
ago), his new wife, who as such must allow Mrs Gordon to desire
to make her acquaintance, and who was, moreover, an old Scotch
friend of her husband&rsquo;s.&nbsp; In short, every one was
named, from the rector&mdash;who had been appointed to Cranford
in the interim between Captain Brown&rsquo;s death and Miss
Jessie&rsquo;s marriage, and was now associated with the latter
event&mdash;down to Miss Betty Barker.&nbsp; All were asked to
the luncheon; all except Mrs Fitz-Adam, who had come to live in
Cranford since Miss Jessie Brown&rsquo;s days, and whom I found
rather moping on account of the omission.&nbsp; People wondered
at Miss <a name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
251</span>Betty Barker&rsquo;s being included in the honourable
list; but, then, as Miss Pole said, we must remember the
disregard of the genteel proprieties of life in which the poor
captain had educated his girls, and for his sake we swallowed our
pride.&nbsp; Indeed, Mrs Jamieson rather took it as a compliment,
as putting Miss Betty (formerly <i>her</i> maid) on a level with
&ldquo;those Hogginses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But when I arrived in Cranford, nothing was as yet ascertained
of Mrs Jamieson&rsquo;s own intentions; would the honourable lady
go, or would she not?&nbsp; Mr Peter declared that she should and
she would; Miss Pole shook her head and desponded.&nbsp; But Mr
Peter was a man of resources.&nbsp; In the first place, he
persuaded Miss Matty to write to Mrs Gordon, and to tell her of
Mrs Fitz-Adam&rsquo;s existence, and to beg that one so kind, and
cordial, and generous, might be included in the pleasant
invitation.&nbsp; An answer came back by return of post, with a
pretty little note for Mrs Fitz-Adam, and a request that Miss
Matty would deliver it herself and explain the previous
omission.&nbsp; Mrs Fitz-Adam was as pleased as could be, and
thanked Miss Matty over and over again.&nbsp; Mr Peter had said,
&ldquo;Leave Mrs Jamieson to me;&rdquo; so we did; especially as
we knew nothing that we could do to alter her determination if
once formed.</p>
<p>I did not know, nor did Miss Matty, how things were going on,
until Miss Pole asked me, just the day before Mrs Gordon came, if
I thought there was anything between Mr Peter and Mrs Jamieson in
the matrimonial line, for that Mrs Jamieson was really going to
the lunch at the &ldquo;George.&rdquo;&nbsp; She <a
name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 252</span>had sent Mr
Mulliner down to desire that there might be a footstool put to
the warmest seat in the room, as she meant to come, and knew that
their chairs were very high.&nbsp; Miss Pole had picked this
piece of news up, and from it she conjectured all sorts of
things, and bemoaned yet more.&nbsp; &ldquo;If Peter should
marry, what would become of poor dear Miss Matty?&nbsp; And Mrs
Jamieson, of all people!&rdquo;&nbsp; Miss Pole seemed to think
there were other ladies in Cranford who would have done more
credit to his choice, and I think she must have had someone who
was unmarried in her head, for she kept saying, &ldquo;It was so
wanting in delicacy in a widow to think of such a
thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When I got back to Miss Matty&rsquo;s I really did begin to
think that Mr Peter might be thinking of Mrs Jamieson for a wife,
and I was as unhappy as Miss Pole about it.&nbsp; He had the
proof sheet of a great placard in his hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;Signor
Brunoni, Magician to the King of Delhi, the Rajah of Oude, and
the great Lama of Thibet,&rdquo; &amp;c. &amp;c., was going to
&ldquo;perform in Cranford for one night only,&rdquo; the very
next night; and Miss Matty, exultant, showed me a letter from the
Gordons, promising to remain over this gaiety, which Miss Matty
said was entirely Peter&rsquo;s doing.&nbsp; He had written to
ask the signor to come, and was to be at all the expenses of the
affair.&nbsp; Tickets were to be sent gratis to as many as the
room would hold.&nbsp; In short, Miss Matty was charmed with the
plan, and said that to-morrow Cranford would remind her of the
Preston Guild, to which she had been in her youth&mdash;a
luncheon at the &ldquo;George,&rdquo; with the dear Gordons, and
the signor <a name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
253</span>in the Assembly Room in the evening.&nbsp; But
I&mdash;I looked only at the fatal words:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Under the Patronage of the</i> <span
class="smcap">Honourable Mrs Jamieson</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She, then, was chosen to preside over this entertainment of Mr
Peter&rsquo;s; she was perhaps going to displace my dear Miss
Matty in his heart, and make her life lonely once more!&nbsp; I
could not look forward to the morrow with any pleasure; and every
innocent anticipation of Miss Matty&rsquo;s only served to add to
my annoyance.</p>
<p>So, angry and irritated, and exaggerating every little
incident which could add to my irritation, I went on till we were
all assembled in the great parlour at the
&ldquo;George.&rdquo;&nbsp; Major and Mrs Gordon and pretty Flora
and Mr Ludovic were all as bright and handsome and friendly as
could be; but I could hardly attend to them for watching Mr
Peter, and I saw that Miss Pole was equally busy.&nbsp; I had
never seen Mrs Jamieson so roused and animated before; her face
looked full of interest in what Mr Peter was saying.&nbsp; I drew
near to listen.&nbsp; My relief was great when I caught that his
words were not words of love, but that, for all his grave face,
he was at his old tricks.&nbsp; He was telling her of his travels
in India, and describing the wonderful height of the Himalaya
mountains: one touch after another added to their size, and each
exceeded the former in absurdity; but Mrs Jamieson really enjoyed
all in perfect good faith.&nbsp; I suppose she required strong
stimulants to excite her to come out of her apathy.&nbsp; Mr
Peter wound up his account by saying that, of course, at that
altitude there were none of the animals to be found that <a
name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 254</span>existed in
the lower regions; the game,&mdash;everything was
different.&nbsp; Firing one day at some flying creature, he was
very much dismayed when it fell, to find that he had shot a
cherubim!&nbsp; Mr Peter caught my eye at this moment, and gave
me such a funny twinkle, that I felt sure he had no thoughts of
Mrs Jamieson as a wife from that time.&nbsp; She looked
uncomfortably amazed&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Mr Peter, shooting a cherubim&mdash;don&rsquo;t
you think&mdash;I am afraid that was sacrilege!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Peter composed his countenance in a moment, and appeared
shocked at the idea, which, as he said truly enough, was now
presented to him for the first time; but then Mrs Jamieson must
remember that he had been living for a long time among
savages&mdash;all of whom were heathens&mdash;some of them, he
was afraid, were downright Dissenters.&nbsp; Then, seeing Miss
Matty draw near, he hastily changed the conversation, and after a
little while, turning to me, he said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be
shocked, prim little Mary, at all my wonderful stories.&nbsp; I
consider Mrs Jamieson fair game, and besides I am bent on
propitiating her, and the first step towards it is keeping her
well awake.&nbsp; I bribed her here by asking her to let me have
her name as patroness for my poor conjuror this evening; and I
don&rsquo;t want to give her time enough to get up her rancour
against the Hogginses, who are just coming in.&nbsp; I want
everybody to be friends, for it harasses Matty so much to hear of
these quarrels.&nbsp; I shall go at it again by-and-by, so you
need not look shocked.&nbsp; I intend to enter the Assembly Room
to-night with Mrs Jamieson on one side, and my lady, Mrs Hoggins,
on the other.&nbsp; You see if I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

conversation together.&nbsp; Major and Mrs Gordon helped at the
good work with their perfect ignorance of any existing coolness
between any of the inhabitants of Cranford.</p>
<p>Ever since that day there has been the old friendly
sociability in Cranford society; which I am thankful for, because
of my dear Miss Matty&rsquo;s love of peace and kindliness.&nbsp;
We all love Miss Matty, and I somehow think we are all of us
better when she is near us.</p>
